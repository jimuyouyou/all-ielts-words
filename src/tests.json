My name is Jamie. How can I help you?","ANDREA:             <b>Good morning</b>. I want <b>some information</b> on self-drive tours in the USA. Could you <b>send me</b> a brochure?","TRAVEL AGENT:   Of course. Could you I <b>have your name</b> please?","ANDREA:             Andrea Brown. (Example)","TRAVEL AGENT:   Thank you. And your address?","ANDREA:             24, Ardleigh Road. (Q1)","TRAVEL AGENT:   Can you spell that?","ANDREA:             A-R-D-L-E-I-G-H Road.","TRAVEL AGENT:   Postcode?","ANDREA:             BH5 2OP","TRAVEL AGENT:   Thanks. And can I have your <b>phone number</b>?","ANDREA:             Is a mobile alright?","TRAVEL AGENT:   Fine.","ANDREA:             It’s 07786643091.","TRAVEL AGENT:   Thank you. And can I ask you where you heard about <b>World Tours</b>? From a friend? Or did you see an advert somewhere?","ANDREA:             No, I read about you in the newspaper. (Q2)","TRAVEL AGENT:   OK, I’ll get the brochures in the post to you but can I give you <b>some information</b> over the phone. What kinds of things <b>do you want</b> to do on your holiday?","ANDREA:             I’m interested in going to California with my family. I’ve got <b>two children</b> and we want to hire a car.","TRAVEL AGENT:   OK. We have a couple of self-drive tours there visiting different <b>places of interest</b> in California. The <b>first one</b> begins in <b>Los Angeles</b> and there’s <b>plenty of time</b> to visit some of the theme (Q3) parks there.","ANDREA:             That’s something on my children’s list so I’d <b>want to include</b> that.","TRAVEL AGENT:   Good. Then you drive to <b>San Francisco</b>. From <b>San Francisco</b> you can drive to Yosemite Park where you spend a couple of nights. You can choose to stay in a<b> lodge </b>or on the campsite.","ANDREA:             I don’t <b>like the idea</b> of staying in a tent (Q4). It’d be <b>too hot</b>.","TRAVEL AGENT:   Right. And the tour ends in <b>Las Vegas</b>.","ANDREA:             OK.","TRAVEL AGENT:   The <b>other trip</b> we can arrange is <b>slightly different</b>. It starts in <b>San Francisco</b>. Then you drive south to Cambria.","ANDREA:             <b><b>Someone told</b> me</b> there’s a <b>really nice</b><b> castle </b>(Q5) near Cambria. Will we go near that?","TRAVEL AGENT:   Hearst<b> Castle </b>is on that road so you could stop there.","ANDREA:             Good. I’d <b>like to do</b> that. Does this trip also go into the desert?","TRAVEL AGENT:   No, it continues to Santa Monica where <b>most people</b> like to stop and <b>do <b>some shopping</b></b>.","ANDREA:             We <b>have enough</b> of that at home so that doesn’t interest us.","TRAVEL AGENT:   OK. Well you could <b>go straight</b> on to San Diego.","ANDREA:             That’s good for beaches isn’t it? (Q6)","TRAVEL AGENT:   That’s right, that’s a <b>good place</b> to relax and your children might like to visit the zoo before flying home.","ANDREA:             I don’t think so. We want <b>some time</b> for<b> sunbathing </b>and swimming.","—————————–","ANDREA:             So how many days are the trips and how much do they cost?","TRAVEL AGENT:   The <b>first one</b> I told you about is a self-drive tour through California which lasts <b>twelve days</b> and covers 2,020 (Q7) kilometres.

And the <b>other trip</b>?","TRAVEL AGENT:   That lasts nine days but you spend <b>only three</b> days on the road. You cover about 980 kilometres altogether.","ANDREA:             So is that cheaper then?","TRAVEL AGENT:   Yes, it’s almost a hundred pounds cheaper. It’s £429 (Q9) <b>per person</b>, which is a good deal.","ANDREA:             So that covers accommodation and car hire. What about flights?","TRAVEL AGENT:   They aren’t included.

My name’s Sandy Fisher and I’m one of the fitness managers here. Before we <b>start our tour</b> of the club I’ll <b>just <b>run through some</b></b> basic information about the<b> facilities </b>we have here, including recent improvements, and explain the <b>types of membership</b> available.","Our <b>greatest asset</b> is probably our <b>swimming pool</b> which at 25 metres isn’t Olympic-sized, but now we’ve expanded it to eight lanes, it’s <b>much wider</b> (Q11&Q12). This means there are rarely more than a <b>couple of people</b> at a <b>time in each</b> lane. Unfortunately, there isn’t space for an outdoor pool here but the glass roof on the <b>swimming pool</b> is partly retractable, which means you can enjoy something of the open-air experience on warmer days.","Our recently<b> refurbished </b><b>fitness suite</b> (Q11&Q12) <b>has all</b> the latest exercise equipment including ten new running machines, and a <b>wide range</b> of weight-training machines. Each member is <b>given full</b> training in how to operate the equipment and there is always a<b> trainer </b>on duty to offer help and advice. Although we <b>do have</b> adult-only times after 6 and at certain times at weekends, children are well<b> catered </b>for. <b>Older children</b> continue to benefit from a <b>wide range</b> of tuition; anything from<b> trampolining </b>to yoga.","——————–","<b>One thing</b> all our members appreciate about us is that we take very <b>good care</b> of them. This starts on <b>day one</b> with your personal assessment. You are asked to fill in a questionnaire giving details of any <b>health problems</b> (Q13). One of our <b>personal trainer</b>s will then go through this with you.","The<b> trainer </b>will then take you through the <b>safety rules</b> (Q14) for using the equipment in the <b>fitness suite</b>. During your next exercise session a <b>personal trainer</b> will work with you to <b>make <b>sure you understand</b></b> these. It’s <b>very important</b> to do this because we <b>really do</b> <b>want to avoid</b> <b>having any</b> sports injuries. There’s a lot more to looking after yourself than simply lifting weights!","At the end of the personal assessment, the<b> trainer </b>will <b>draw up</b> a plan, outlining what you should try to achieve within a six-week period (Q15). This will then be reviewed at the end of the <b>six weeks</b>.","Now, I’ll just quickly run through the <b>types of membership</b> we have available. All members must pay a joining fee of £90 (Q16) in addition to the rates for the monthly membership fees. <b>Gold membership</b><b> entitles </b>you to free entry at all <b>LP Clubs</b> (Q17). There are now <b>LP clubs</b> in all <b>major cities</b> and towns so if you travel a lot will be a great advantage. Individual <b>gold membership</b> costs £50 a month and joint membership for you and your partner will cost £75.","<b><b>Premier members</b>hip</b> is for professional people whose work commitments <b>make it difficult</b> for them to use the club <b>during the day</b> and so LP gives booking preferences to <b>Premier members</b> at peak times (Q18). This means you will <b>find it easier</b> to book the sessions at times that suit you. Reciprocal arrangements with other <b>LP Clubs</b> are available to <b>Premier members</b>. <b><b>Premier members</b>hip</b> is for individuals only, but you will be sent passes for guests <b>every month</b> (Q19). The monthly fee is £65.","You don’t <b>have to have</b> <b>any special</b> clothes or equipment when you visit the club. We provide<b> robes </b>and<b> hairdryers </b>in the changing rooms, but it’s <b>very important</b> to remember your photo card (Q20) because you won’t be <b>able to get</b> in without it.","For people who aren’t working <b>during the day</b> then …","#3 <b>Global <b>Design Competition</b></b> Transcript","The Part 3 <b>audio transcript</b> of <b>Global <b>Design Competition</b></b> in Cambridge 10 <b>Listening Test</b> 1 is as follows:","JOHN:                   Erm … hello Professor, I’m John Wishart. I’m working on my entry for the <b>Global <b>Design Competition</b></b>. My tutor said you might be <b>able to help</b> me with it.","PROFESSOR:       Ah, yes, I got a copy of your drawings. Come in and <b>tell me</b> about it. What sort of competition is it?","JOHN:                   Well, it’s an international <b>design competition</b> and we <b>have to come</b> up with a <b>new design</b> for a typical domestic <b>kitchen appliance</b>. (Q21)","PROFESSOR:       I see, and are there <b>any special</b> conditions? <b>Does it have</b> to save energy for example?","JOHN:                   Actually that was the focus in <b>last year</b>’s competition. This year’s different. We have to adopt an innovative approach to existing technology, using it in a way that hasn’t been thought of before.","PROFESSOR:       I see, that sounds tricky. And what <b>kitchen appliance</b> have you chosen?","JOHN:                   Well, they’re an everyday <b>kitchen appliance</b> in most Australian houses but they’re all pretty boring and almost identical to <b>each other</b>. I think <b>some people</b> will be prepared to pay a little extra for something that looks different. (Q22)","PROFESSOR:       That’s a nice idea. I see you’ve called your design ‘the Rockpool’; why is that?","JOHN:                   Basically because it <b>looks like</b> the <b>rock pools</b> you find on a beach. The top is made of glass so that you can <b>look down</b> into it.","PROFESSOR:       And there’s a stone at the bottom. Is that just for decoration?","JOHN:                   Actually it <b>does have</b> a function. Instead of pushing a button, you turn the stone. (Q23)","PROFESSOR:       So it’s <b>really just</b> a novel way of starting the dishwasher.","JOHN:                   That’s right.","PROFESSOR:       It’s a <b>really nice</b> design, but what makes it innovative?","JOHN:                   Well, I decided to make a dishwasher that uses <b>carbon dioxide</b>.","PROFESSOR:       In place of water and detergent? How will you manage that?","JOHN:                   The idea is to<b> pressurize </b>the <b>carbon dioxide</b> so that it becomes a liquid. The fluid is then released into the dishwasher where it cleans the dishes all by itself.","PROFESSOR:       <b>Sounds like</b> a brilliant idea! Your system will totally do away with the need for strong detergents. So what happens once the dishes are clean?","JOHN:                   Well, to allow them to dry, the liquid <b>carbon dioxide</b> and the waste materials all go to an area called the holding chamber. That’s where the liquid is<b> depressurised </b>and so it reverts to a gas (Q24). Then the oil and<b> grease </b>are<b> separated </b>out and sent to the waste system.","PROFESSOR:       It <b>sounds like</b> you’ve thought it all out very thoroughly. So, what happens to the <b>carbon dioxide</b> once the process is complete? Not wasted I hope.","JOHN:                   Actually, that’s where the real savings are made. The <b>carbon dioxide</b> is sent back to the<b> cylinder </b>and can be used again and again. (Q25)","PROFESSOR:       What a<b> terrific </b>idea. <b>Do you think</b> it will ever be built?","JOHN:                   Probably not, but that’s OK.","PROFESSOR:       Well, I’m sure a lot of <b>positive things</b> will come out of your design.","——————————-","PROFESSOR:       Now, you seem to <b>have thought</b> about everything so what exactly did you <b>need me</b> to help you with?","JOHN:                   Well, my <b>design has</b> made it to the <b>final stage</b> of the competition and, in a <b>few months</b>’ time. I <b>have to give</b> a presentation, and that’s the part I was<b> hoping </b>you could <b>help me</b> with. (Q26)","PROFESSOR:       Right, well that should be <b>easy enough</b>. What have you managed to do so far?","JOHN:                   Well, I’ve got detailed drawings to show how it will work and I’ve also written a 500-word paper on it.","PROFESSOR:       I see. Well, if you want to stand a <b>good chance</b> of winning you <b>really need</b> a model of the machine. (Q27)","JOHN:                   Yes, I thought I might but I’m having a few problems.","PROFESSOR:       What is the main difficulty so far? <b>Let <b>me guess</b></b> – is it the materials?","JOHN:                   Yes. I want it to look professional but everything that’s top quality is also <b>very expensive</b>. (Q28)","PROFESSOR:       Look, projects like this are <b>very important</b> to us. They really help lift our profile. So why don’t you talk to the university about a grant? (Q29) I can help you fill out the <b><b>application form</b>s</b> if you like.","JOHN:                   That would be a great.","PROFESSOR:       You’d better show me this paper you’ve written as well. For a global competition such as this you <b><b>need to make</b> sure</b> the technical details you’ve given are accurate and thorough. (Q30)","JOHN:                   That would be a <b>great help</b>.","PROFESSOR:       Is there anything else I can do?","JOHN:                   Well, I’m really …","#4 The <b>Spirit Bear</b> Transcript","The Part 4 <b>audio transcript</b> of The <b>Spirit Bear</b> in Cambridge 10 <b>Listening Test</b> 1 is as follows:","Today we continue our series on<b> ecology </b>and conservation with a look at a particularly endangered member of the black bear family. One in ten black bears is <b>actually born</b> with a white coat, which is the result of a special gene that surfaces in a few (Q31).","<b>Local people</b> <b>have named</b> it ‘the <b>spirit bear</b>’. And according to the legends of these communities, its snowy fur brings with it a special power (Q32). Because of this, it <b>has always</b> been <b>highly regarded</b> by them – so much that they do not speak of seeing it to anyone else. It is their way of protecting it when strangers visit the area. (Q33)","The white bear’s habitat is <b>quite interesting</b>. The bear’s strong relationship with the old-growth rainforest is a complex one. The white bear relies on the huge centuries-old trees in the forest in <b>many ways</b>. For example, the old-growth <b>trees have</b> extremely long roots that help prevent erosion of the soil along the banks of the <b>many fish</b> streams (Q34).","Keeping these banks intact is <b>important because</b> these streams are home to salmon, which are the bear’s main food source. In return, the bear’s feeding habits nurture the forest. As the bears eat the salmon, they discard the skin and bones in great amounts on the forest floor, which provide vital nutrients. These produce lush<b> vegetation </b>that<b> sustains </b>thousands of <b>other types</b> of life forms, from birds to insects and more.","Today, the <b>spirit bear</b> lives off the coast of the province of <b>British Columbia</b> on a few islands (Q35). There is great concern for their survival since it is<b> estimated </b>that less than <b>two hundred</b> of these white bears remain. The <b>best way</b> to protect them is to <b>make every</b> effort to<b> preserve </b>the <b>delicate balance</b> of their forest environment – in other words, their ecosystem.","———————–","The greatest threat to the bear’s existence is the loss of its habitat. Over many years, <b>logging companies</b> have<b> stripped </b>the land by <b>cutting down</b> a large <b>number of trees</b>. In addition, they <b>have built</b> roads which have<b> fractured </b>the areas where the bear usually feeds, and many hibernation sites <b>have also</b> been lost (Q36).","The logging of the trees along the streams has damaged the places where the bears fish. To make matters worse, the number of<b> salmon </b>in those streams is declining because there is no legal limit on fishing at the moment. (Q37)","all these influences have a negative impact on the <b>spirit bear</b>’s very existence, which is made all the more fragile by the fact that reproduction among these bears <b>has always</b> been disappointingly low. (Q38)","And so, what’s the situation <b>going forward</b>? Community organizations, environmental groups and the <b>British Columbia</b> government are now <b>working together</b> on the problem. The government is now requiring <b>logging companies</b> to adopt a better logging method (Q39), which is a positive step. However, these measures alone may not be sufficient to ensure a healthy population of the <b>spirit bear</b> in the future.","Other steps <b>also need</b> to be taken. While it is important to maintain the <b>spirit bear</b>’s habitat, there <b><b>also need</b>s</b> to be more<b> emphasis </b>on its expansion (Q40). The move is justified as it will also create space for other bears that are losing their homes …"]},{"name":"ALS/10-2","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Transport Survey Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of the <b>Transport Survey</b> <b><b>listening <b>answers in Listening</b></b> Test</b> 2 is as follows:","INTERVIEWER:   Excuse me.","LUISA:                  Yes?","INTERVIEWER:   I wonder if you could <b>spare a <b>few minutes</b></b> to do a survey on transport.

I’m very <b>pleased to have</b> this opportunity to <b>say a little</b> about two <b>exciting new</b> developments in the city: the Brackenside Open-Air <b>Swimming Pool</b> and the children’s <b>Adventure Playground</b> in <b>Central Park</b>. As many of you may know, the idea for these initiatives came from you, the public (Q11), in the extensive consultation exercise which the <b>City Council</b> conducted <b>last year</b>. And they have been realised using money from the SWRDC – the South West Regional Development Commission.","<b>First of all</b>, Brackenside Pool. As many of the older <b>members of the audience</b> will remember, there used to be a wonderful open-air pool on the sea front 30 <b>years ago</b> but it had to close when it was judged to be unsafe. For the design of this new heated pool, we were <b>very happy</b> to secure the talents of internationally<b> renowned </b>architect Ellen Wendon, who <b>has managed</b> to combine a charming 1930s design, which fits is so well with <b>many of the other</b> buildings in the area, with up-to-the-minute features such as a<b> recycling </b>system – the <b>only one</b> of its kind in the world – which enables<b> seawater </b>to be used in the pool. (Q12)","Now, there has been <b>quite a bit</b> of discussion in the local press about whether there would be enough room for the <b>number of visitors</b> we’re<b> hoping </b>to attract (Q13), but the design is deceptive and there have been<b> rigorous </b>checks about capacity. Also, just in case you were wondering, we’re on schedule for a June 15th <b>opening date</b> and well within budget: a<b> testimony </b>to the <b>excellent work</b> of local contractors Hickman’s.","We hope that as <b>many <b>people as possible</b></b> will be there on June 15th. We have engaged award-winning actress Coral White to declare the pool open and there’ll be <b>drinks and snacks</b> available at the pool side. There’ll also be a competition for the public to decide on the<b> sculpture </b>we plan to have at the entrance: you will decide which famous historical figure from the city we should have. (Q14)","————————","And now, moving on the <b>Central Park</b> Playground, which we’re pleased to announce <b>has just</b> won the Douglas Award for safety: the <b>news came</b> through only <b>last week</b>. The unique design is based on the concept of the Global Village, with the playground being divided into sex areas showing <b>different <b>parts of the world</b></b> – each with a<b> representative </b>feature. For example, there is a section on Asia, and this is represented by rides and equipment in the shape of snakes, orang-utans, tigers and so on –<b> fauna </b>native to the forests of the region (Q15).","<b>Moving south</b> to the Antarctic – we couldn’t run to an ice<b> rink </b>I’m afraid but<b> opted </b>instead for climbing blocks in the shape of mountains (Q16) – I thought they could <b>have had</b> slides for the<b> glaciers </b>but the designers did <b>want to avoid</b> being too literal! Then on to <b>South America</b> – and here the theme is El Dorado – games<b> replicating </b>the search for mines full of<b> precious </b>stones (Q17).","And then <b>moving up</b> to <b>North America</b>, here there was considerable debate – I know the contribution of cinema and jazz was considered but the designers finally<b> opted </b>for rockets and the international Space Station (Q18). Eastwards to Europe then, and <b>perhaps the most</b> traditional choice of all the areas:<b> medieval </b>castles and other<b> fortifications </b>(Q19).","Then last, but not least, <b>moving south</b> to Africa and a whole set of wonderful<b> mosaics </b>and<b> trails </b>to represent the great rivers of this fascinating and varied continent. (Q20)","Now, the <b>opening date</b> for our Global Playground is 10th July. And again we’d love to see you there – so make a date and <b>come and see</b> this magnificent, original new amenity right in the heart of the city.","#3 <b>Thor Heyerdahl</b> Transcript","The Part 3 <b>audio transcript</b> of <b>Thor Heyerdahl</b> in Cambridge 10 <b>Listening Test</b> 2 is as follows:","VICTOR:               Right, well, for our presentation shall I start with the early life of <b>Thor Heyerdahl</b>?","OLIVIA:                Sure. Why don’t you begin with describing the type of boy he was, especially his passion for collecting things. (Q21&Q22)","VICTOR:               That’s right, he had his own the little museum. And I think it’s<b> unusual </b>for children to develop their own values and not join in their parents’ hobbies; I’m thinking of how Heyerdahl wouldn’t go<b> hunting </b>with his dad, for example.","OLIVIA:                Yeah, he<b> preferred </b>to learn about nature by listening to his mother read to him. And quite early on he knew he wanted to become an<b> explorer </b>when he <b>grew up</b>. That came from his camping trips he went on in Norway I think …","VICTOR:               No, it was climbing that he spent his time on as a <b>young man</b>. (Q21&Q22)","OLIVIA:                Oh, right … After university he married a classmate and together, they decided to experience living on a <b>small island</b>, to find out how harsh <b>weather conditions</b> shaped people’s lifestyles. (Q23&Q24)","VICTOR:               As part of their preparation before they left home, they<b> learnt </b>basic survival skills <b>like building</b> a shelter. I guess they needed that knowledge in order to live wild in a remote location with few inhabitants, cut of by the sea, which is what they were aiming to do.","OLIVIA:                An <b>important part</b> of your talk should be the<b> radical </b>theory Heyerdahl formed from examining<b> mysterious </b>ancient carvings that he happened to find on the island. I think you should finish with that.","VICTOR:               OK.","————————-","OLIVIA:                <b>All right</b>, Victor, so after your part I’ll talk about <b>Thor Heyerdahl</b>’s adult life, continuing from the theory he had about Polynesian migration: <b>Up until</b> that time of course, academics had believed that humans first migrated to the islands in Polynesia from Asia, in the west.","VICTOR:               Yes, they thought that travel from the east was impossible, because of the huge, empty stretch of ocean that lies between the islands and the nearest<b> inhabited </b>land. (Q25)","OLIVIA:                Yes, but Heyerdahl spent ages studying the cloud movements, ocean currents and wind patterns to find if it was actually possible. And another argument was that there was no tradition of large ship-building in the communities lying to the east of Polynesia. But Heyerdahl knew they made lots of coastal<b> voyages </b>in locally <b>built canoes</b>.","VICTOR:               Yes, or sailing on rafts, as was shown by the long<b> voyage </b>that Heyerdahl did next. It was an incredibly risky journey to undertake – sometimes I wonder if he did that trip for private reasons, you know? To show others that he could have<b> spectacular </b>adventures. What <b>do you think</b>, Olivia?","OLIVIA:                Well, I think it was more a matter of simply trying out his idea, to see if migration from the east was possible. (Q26)","VICTOR:               Yes, that’s probably it. And the poor guy suffered a bit at that <b>time because</b> the war <b>forced him</b> to stop his <b>work for some</b> years …","OLIVIA:                Yes. When he got started again and planned his<b> epic </b>voyage, <b>do you think</b> it was important to him that he achieve it before anyone else did?","VICTOR:               Um, I haven’t <b>read any</b>where that that was his motivation. The most <b>important factor</b> <b>seems to have</b> been that he <b>use only</b> ancient techniques and local materials to build his raft. (Q27)","OLIVIA:                Yes. I wonder how fast it went.","VICTOR:               Well, it took them 97 days from <b>South America</b> to the <b>Pacific Island</b>.","OLIVIA:                Mm. And after that, Heyerdahl went to <b>Easter Island</b>, didn’t he? We should mention the purpose of that trip. I think he sailed there in a boat made out of reeds.","VICTOR:               No, that was later on in Egypt, Olivia.","OLIVIA:                Oh, yes, that’s right.","VICTOR:               But what he <b>wanted to do</b> was talk to the <b>local people</b> about their old stone carvings and then make one himself to learn more about the process. (Q28)","OLIVIA:                I see. Well, what a great life. <b>Even though</b> many of his <b>theories have</b> been disproven, he certainly left a lasting impression on many disciplines, didn’t he? To my mind, he was <b>first person</b> to establish what modern academics call practical archaeology. I mean, that they try to<b> recreate </b>something from the past today (Q29), like he did with his<b> raft </b>trip. It’s unfortunate that his ideas about where Polynesians<b> originated </b>from <b>have been completely</b> discredited.","VICTOR:               Yes. Right, well, I’ll prepare a PowerPoint slide at the end that acknowledges our sources. I mainly used The Life and Work of <b>Thor Heyerdahl</b> by William Oliver. The research methods he used were very sound, although I must say I found the overall tone somewhat old-fashioned. I think they <b>need to do</b> a new, revised edition. (Q30)","OLIVIA:                Yeah, I agree. What about the <b>subject matter</b> – I found it <b>really challenging</b>!","VICTOR:               Well, it’s a complex issue …","OLIVIA:                I thought the book had <b>lots of good</b> points. What <b>did you think</b> of …","#4 The <b>future of Management</b> Transcript","The Part 4 <b>audio transcript</b> of The <b>future of Management</b> in Cambridge 10 <b>Listening Test</b> 2 is as follows:","Well, I’ve been talking to managers in a number of businesses, and reading surveys about the <b>future of management</b>. And what I’m going to present in this<b> seminar </b>is a <b>few ideas</b> about how the activity is <b>likely to change</b> in the <b>next <b>ten years</b></b>. It isn’t a scientific,<b> statistical </b>analysis – just <b><b>some idea</b>s</b> for us to discuss.","<b>One area</b> I <b>want to mention</b> is business markets, and I’m sure a really significant development will be a major increase in competition, with companies from all <b>round the world</b> <b>trying to sell</b> similar products (Q31). Consumers will <b>have much</b> more choice – for instance, <b>food products</b> sold in Australia might be manufactured in the USA, China, Finland and dozens of <b>other countries</b>. At the <b>same time</b>, mergers and takeovers mean that governments are actually losing power to major global<b> corporations </b>(Q32).","We can <b>probably all</b> think of companies that exert a <b>great deal</b> of influence, which may be good for consumers. A third point I <b>want to make</b> about markets is that in the rapidly expanding economies, such as India, China, Brazil and Russia, demand is growing <b>very fast</b> (Q33). This is putting pressure on resources <b>all over the world</b>.","<b>I </b> think businesses are becoming more open to<b> external </b>influences. In particular, companies are<b> consulting </b>customers more and more before making their business decisions (Q34). Companies are finding out what they want and providing it, instead of making products and then <b>trying to sell</b> them, which is the model of <b>years ago</b>.","Another influence is that <b>concerns about the environment</b> will force manufacturers to extend product lifecycles, to reduce the <b>amount of pollution</b> and waste. And in <b>some cases</b>, regulation will need to be strengthened. (Q35)","Many<b> societies </b>are much more fluid and democratic, and the structure of companies is changing to reflect that. I think we’re <b>going to see</b> a greater<b> emphasis </b>within companies on teams created with a specific project in mind (Q36). And when they’re completed, the teams will be<b> disbanded </b>and <b>new ones</b> formed.","More and more <b>people see</b> work as simply <b>one part</b> of their lifestyle, and not the <b>most important</b> one, and as the workforce is<b> shrinking </b>in some countries, businesses are having to compete for staff instead of being about to choose among a lot of applicants. Typical examples that will attract and retain staff are traditional ones like flexible hours (Q37) and – <b>something that has</b> been <b>made possible</b> by advances in technology – remote working, with people based at their home, abroad, or <b><b>almost any</b>where</b> they choose.","——————-","Management styles will <b>almost certainly</b> continue to change. <b>Senior managers</b> will require a lot more than the efficiency that they’ve always needed. Above all they’ll need great skills in leadership (Q38), so that their organisation can initiate and respond to change in a fast-moving world, where they face lots of competing requirements and potential conflicts.","In most of the world, the <b>senior managers</b> of large businesses are mainly men in their fifties and sixties. The predominant style of management will <b>almost certainly</b> become more<b> consultative </b>and collaborative, caused above all, by more women moving into senior management positions. (Q39)","Many of the changes are influenced by developments in the wider economy. The traditional<b> emphasis </b>of business was manufacturing, and of course the service sector is <b>very important</b>. But we shouldn’t overlook the growing financial contribution of IP, that is, intellectual property. Some books and films generate enormous sums from the sale of related DVDs, music, games, clothes, and so on.","Another point I’d <b>like to make</b> is that although I’ve been talking about companies, <b>one trend</b> that they have to face is the <b>move away</b> from <b>people working</b> for the <b>same employer</b> for years. Instead, more and more people are becoming self-employed (Q40), to gain the freedom and control over their lives that they’re <b>unlikely to get</b> from being employed.","OK, well that’s all I want to say, so let’s open it up for discussion."]},{"name":"ALS/10-3","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Early Learning Childcare Centre Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of <b>Early <b><b>Learning Childcare</b> Centre</b></b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 3 is as follows:","DIRECTOR:          <b>Good morning</b>.

Tell us about the Trust, Alice.","ALICE:                  Well, obviously its purpose is to protect dolphins in seas all a<b>round the world</b>. It tries to raise people’s awareness of the problems these marine creatures are suffering because of<b> pollution </b>and other threats. It started <b>ten years</b> ago and it’s one of the fastest growing animal charities in the country – although it’s <b>still fairly</b> small compared with the big players in animal protection.","We are particularly proud of the work we do in education – <b>last year</b> we visited a huge <b>number of schools</b> in <b>different parts</b> of the country, going round to talk to <b><b>children and young</b> people</b> aged from five to eighteen.","In fact, about thirty-five <b>per cent</b> of our members are children. The charity uses its <b>money to support</b> campaigns – for example, for changes in fishing policy and so forth (Q11&Q12). It hopes soon to be able to employ its first full-time biologist – with dolphin expertise – to monitor populations. Of course, <b>many people</b> give their services on a voluntary basis and we <b>now have</b> volunteers working in observation, <b>office work</b> and <b>other things</b>. (Q11&Q12)","<b>I </b> should <b>also tell</b> you about the award we won from the Charity<b> Commission </b><b>last year</b> – for our work in education. Although it’s not meant an enormous <b>amount of money</b> for us, it <b>has made</b> our activities even more <b>widely publicised</b> and understood (Q13). In the <b>long term</b> it may not bring in extra members but we’re<b> hoping </b>it’ll have this effect.","INTERVIEWER:   Is it possible to <b>see dolphins</b> in UK waters?","ALICE:                  Yes. In <b>several locations</b>. And we have a <b>big project</b> in the east part of Scotland. This <b>has long</b> been a haven for dolphins because it has <b>very little</b> shipping. However, that may be about to change soon because <b>oil companies</b> <b>want to increase</b><b> exploration </b>there. We’re campaigning against this because, although there’ll be little<b> pollution </b>from oil,<b> exploration </b>creates a lot of underwater noise (Q14). It means the dolphins can’t rest and socialise.","This is how I <b>became interested</b> in <b>dolphin conservation</b> in the <b>first place</b>. I <b>had never</b> seen one and I hadn’t been <b>particularly interested</b> in them at school. Then I <b>came across</b> this story about a family of dolphins who had to leave their home in the Moray Firth because of the <b>oil companies</b> and about a child who campaigned to save them. I couldn’t put the book down – I was hooked. (Q15)","—————————","INTERVIEWER:   I’m sure our listeners will <b>want to find</b> out what they can <b>do to help</b>. You mentioned the ‘Adopt a Dolphin’ scheme. Can you tell us about that?","ALICE:                  Of course! People can choose one of our dolphins to sponsor. They receive a picture of it and news updates. I’d <b>like to tell</b> you about four which are currently being adopted by our members: Moondancer, Echo, Kiwi and Samson.","Unfortunately, Echo is being rather<b> elusive </b>this year and hasn’t yet been sighted by our observers (Q16) but we remain<b> optimistic </b>that he’ll be out there soon. <b><b>All the other</b>s</b> have been out in force – Samson and Moondancer are often photographed together but it is Kiwi who’s our real ‘character’ as she seems to love <b>coming up</b> close for the cameras and we’ve captured her on film hundreds of times (Q17).","They all <b>have their own</b><b> personalities </b>– Moondancer is very elegant and curves out and into the water very smoothly, whereas Samson <b>has a lot</b> of energy – he’s always leaping out of the water with great<b> vigour </b>(Q18). You’d probably expect him to be the youngest – he’s not quite – that’s Kiwi – but Samson’s the latest of our dolphins to be chosen for the scheme (Q19).","Kiwi makes a lot of noise so we can often pick her out straightaway. Echo and Moondancer are noisy too, but Moondancer’s <b>easy to find</b> <b>because she has</b> a particularly large fin on her back, which makes her easy to identify (Q20). So, yes, they’re all <b>very different</b> …","INTERVIEWER:   Well, they sound a fascinating group …","#3 <b><b>Theatre Studies</b> Course</b> Transcript","The Part 3 <b>audio <b>transcript of Theatre</b></b> <b>Studies Course</b> in Cambridge 10 <b>Listening Test</b> 3 is as follows:","MIA:      Hi, Rob.

It was good.","ROB:      Really? Yeah … but now we have to <b>write a report</b> on the <b>whole thing</b>, an in-depth analysis. I don’t know where to start. Like, I <b>have to write</b> about the role I played, the doctor, how I developed the character.","MIA:      Well, what was your <b>starting point</b>?","ROB:      Er … my grandfather was a doctor before he retired, and I just based it on him.","MIA:      OK, but how? Did you <b>talk to him</b> about it?","ROB:      He must have <b>all sorts</b> of stories, but he never says much about his work, even now. He has a sort of authority though.","MIA:      So how did you manage to capture that?","ROB:      I’d … I’d visualise what he must <b>have been like</b> in the past, when he was sitting in his<b> consulting </b>room listening to his patients. (Q21)","MIA:      OK, so that’s what you explain in your report.","ROB:      Right.","MIA:      Then there’s the issue of atmosphere – so in the <b>first scene</b> we <b>needed to know</b> how boring life was in the doctor’s village in the 1950s, so when the curtain <b>went up</b> on the <b>first scene</b> in the waiting room, there was that long silence before anyone spoke. And then people kept <b><b>saying the same</b> thing</b> over and over, like ‘Cold, isn’t it?’ (Q22)","ROB:      Yes, and everyone wore grey and brown, and just sat in a row.","MIA:      Yes, all those details of the production.","ROB:      And I <b>have to analyse</b> how I functioned in the group – what I found out about myself. I know I was so frustrated at times, when we couldn’t agree.","MIA:      Yes. So did <b>one person</b><b> emerge </b>as the leader?","ROB:      <b>Sophia did</b>. That was OK – she helped us work out exactly what to do, for the production. And that <b>made me</b> feel better, I suppose. (Q23)","MIA:      When you understood what needed doing?","ROB:      Yes. And <b>Sophia did</b> <b>some research</b>, too. That was useful in developing our approach.","MIA:      Like what?","ROB:      Well, she found these articles from the 1950s about how <b>relationships between children</b> and their parents, or between the public and <b>people like</b> bank managers or the police were shifting. (Q24)","MIA:      Interesting. And <b><b>did you have</b> any</b> practical problems to overcome?","ROB:      Well, in the final<b> rehearsal </b>everything was going fine <b>until the last</b><b> scene </b>– what’s where the doctor’s first patient appears on stage on his own.","MIA:      The one in the wheelchair?","ROB:      Yes, and he had this really long speech, with the stage all dark <b>except for one</b><b> spotlight </b>– and then that<b> stuck </b>somehow so it was shining on the wrong side of the stage (Q25) … but anyway we got that fixed, thank goodness.","MIA:      Yes, it was fine on the night.","———————–","ROB:      But while you’re here, Mia. I <b>wanted to ask</b> you about the year abroad option. Would you recommend doing that?","MIA:      Yes, definitely. It’s a fantastic chance to study in another country for a year.","ROB:      I think I’d <b>like to do</b> it, but it looks <b>very competitive</b> – there’s only a limited number of places.","MIA:      Yes, so <b>next year</b> when you are in the <b>second year</b> of the course, you need to work really hard in all your <b>theatre studies</b> modules. Only students with good marks get places – you have to prove that you know your subject <b>really well</b>. (Q26)","ROB:      Right. So how <b>did you choose</b> where to go?","MIA:      Well, I decided I wanted a programme that would fit in with what I <b>wanted to do</b> after I graduate, so I looked for a university with<b> emphasis </b>on acting rather than directing for example. It depends on you (Q27). Then about <b>six months</b> before you go, you have to email the scheme coordinator with your top three choices. I had a friend who missed the deadline and didn’t get her <b>first choice</b>, so you do <b>need to get</b> a move on at that stage (Q28). You’ll find that <b>certain places</b> are <b>very popular</b> with everyone.","ROB:      And don’t you <b>have to write</b> a personal statement at that stage?","MIA:      Yes.","ROB:      Right. I’ll <b>get some</b> of the <b>final year</b> students to <b><b>give me</b> some</b> tips (Q29) … maybe see if I can read what they wrote.","MIA:      I think that’s a very <b>good idea</b>. I don’t mind showing you what I did. And while you’re abroad don’t make the mistake I made. I got so involved I for<b>got all</b> about making arrangements for when I came <b>back here</b> for the <b>final year</b>. <b>Make sure</b> you <b>stay in touch</b> so they know your choices for the optional modules (Q30).

Self-<b><b>regulatory focus</b> theory</b> is a theory developed by Tori Higgins. He says that a person’ focus at <b>any <b>given time</b></b> is to either approach pleasure or avoid pain. These are two basic motivations that each and <b>every one</b> of us has, and they cause us to have <b>different kinds</b> of goals. <b>Promotion goals</b> in different life situations<b> emphasise </b>achievement (Q31). <b>Prevention goals</b> are<b> oriented </b>towards the avoidance of punishment.","In a specific situation, our thoughts might <b><b>focus more on promotion</b> goals</b> or more on <b>prevention goals</b>. The <b>theory suggests</b> that <b>two factors</b> affect which <b>goals we are focusing</b> on. First, there is a chronic factor. This factor is connected to a person’s personality (Q32) and says that <b>each person</b> has a basic<b> tendency </b>to either <b><b>focus more on promotion</b> goals</b> or focus more on <b>prevention goals</b> as part of his or her personality.","Second, there is a situational factor which means that the context we are in can make us more likely to focus on one set of goals or the other (Q33). For example, we are more likely to be thinking about pleasure and to have <b>promotion goals</b> when we are <b>spending time</b> with a friend (Q34). In contrast, if we are working on an important project for our boss, we are more likely to <b>try to avoid</b> making mistakes and <b>therefore have</b> more <b>prevention goals</b> in our mind.","<b><b>Research has</b> shown</b> that the <b>goals we are focusing</b> on at a <b>given time</b> <b>affect the way</b> we think. For example, when focusing on <b>promotion goals</b>, people consider their ideal self, their aspirations and gains (Q35). They don’t think about what they can lose, so they think in a happier mode. They feel more inspired to change.","When people are focusing on <b>prevention goals</b>, they think about their “ought” self. What are they supposed to be? What are people expecting from them? They consider their obligations to others. As a result, they experience more anxiety and <b>try to avoid</b> situations where they could lose.","———————–","Now that I have talked about the two focuses and how they affect people, I <b>want to look</b> at the idea that the way leaders behave, or their style of leading, can affect the focus that followers adopt in a specific situation (Q36). In talking about leadership, we often mention <b>transformational leaders</b> and <b>transactional leaders</b>. <b>Transformational leaders</b>, when interacting with their followers, focus on their development (Q37).","In their words and actions <b>transformational leaders</b> highlight change. Their speech is passionate and conveys a<b> definitive </b>vision (Q38). All of these things can encourage followers to think about what could be. In other words, they inspire a <b>promotion focus</b> in their followers.","In contrast, <b>transactional leaders</b> focus on developing clear structures that tell their followers exactly what is expected of them (Q39). While they do explain the rewards people will get for following orders, they<b> emphasise </b>more how a follower will be punished or that a follower won’t get rewarded if his or her behaviour doesn’t change. In short, they<b> emphasise </b>the consequences of <b>making a mistake</b>. This<b> emphasis </b>will clearly lead followers to focus on avoiding punishment and problems. This is clearly a <b>prevention focus</b>.","In conclusion, it is important to understand that one focus is not necessarily better than the <b>other one</b>. For a designer who works in a field where a lot of innovation (Q40) is needed, a <b>promotion focus</b> is <b>probably better</b>. In contrast, a <b>prevention focus</b> which causes people to work more cautiously and produce <b>higher quality</b> work might be very appropriate for a job like a surgeon, for example. The <b>main point</b> of the research, though, is that the <b>actions of leaders</b> can greatly influence whether <b>people approach</b> a situation with more of a <b>promotion focus</b> or more of a <b>prevention focus</b>."]},{"name":"ALS/10-4","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Thorndyke’s builders Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of Thorndyke’s builders in <b>Listening Test</b> 4 is as follows:","MR THORNDYKE:    Thorndyke’s","EDITH:                  <b>Good morning</b>.

All the family can enjoy a day out at Manham: visit our copper mine, see models of the<b> machinery </b>it used, have your photo taken in nineteenth-century costume, experience first hand how <b>people lived</b> at <b>different stages</b> throughout history, and especially how children studied, worked and played.","The <b>port of Manham</b> is located in beautiful and peaceful countryside, on a bend in the great River Avon, and developed here because it’s the highest navigable point of the Avon – boats can go no <b>higher up</b> this river – and proved a handy place to load and unload cargo to and from the sea (Q11), which is over 23 miles away.","<b>A </b> small port was <b>already established</b> here when, about 900 <b>years ago</b>,<b> tin </b>was discovered nearby, though it wasn’t until the <b>Industrial Revolution</b>, when a tremendous need for metals of <b>all kinds</b> developed, that Manham expanded to become one of the busiest ports in the country (Q12).","And because it was already so busy, prospectors began to look for other minerals, and by the <b>end of the nineteenth</b> century, lead, copper,<b> manganese </b>and<b> arsenic </b>were added to the cargos leaving Manham.","In the early days, the<b> ores </b>had been<b> smelted </b>– or processed – in the same area they were mined. But, as demand grew, the<b> smelting </b>process required huge factory<b> furnaces </b>or fires to melt the metal from the rock and there was not enough coal in the local area, so the rocks containing minerals had to be shipped <b>long distances</b>. (Q3)","Sadly, in the <b>twentieth century</b>, the great <b>port of Manham</b> declined, and thousands of workers were forced to emigrate out of the area (Q14). The building at the port fell into disrepair, and the place became almost forgotten. But then, the Manham Trust was formed to<b> conserve </b>the historical resources of the area. It organised scores of local volunteers to remove undergrowth to find the original outlines of the installations.","It then brought in paid professionals to match installations with maps of the original port complex and to set about<b> reconstructing </b>it (Q15). Today you can see the results of this ambitious programme of restoration. The intention, and we believe this will be realised before the <b>end of the year</b>, is to return <b>Manham Port</b> to the condition it reached at its peak as ‘the greatest copper port in the country’.","——————","But what can you do and see on your visit today? <b><b>Here are just</b> a few</b> highlights. We suggest you start with the visit to the copper mine. Travel on converted mining trains and journey into the depths of the mountain along<b> seams </b>once worked by hundreds of miners (Q16). Watch out especially for the great<b> pumping </b>machines which<b> rid </b>the mine of water. But please be warned that, <b>like all</b> mines, ours is very dark and closed in and we do say that children under five and <b>also do</b>gs should NOT be taken into the mine. (Q17)","The next recommended visit is to the village school. While looking round the classrooms, take a special look at our display of games, which is <b>one of the <b>largest in the world</b></b> (Q18). And it’s recommended that you time your visit to<b> coincide </b>with a <b>guided tour</b> (Q19). This will <b>give you the opportunity</b> to ask lots of questions.","<b>Near the school</b> is the beautiful <b>old sailing</b><b> ketch </b><b>called ‘The</b> George’. You are welcome to board the boat and look round the cabins. Look out for the shop’s wheel which was missing until only <b>five years</b> ago when it was<b> dredged </b>out of the<b> silt </b>by a local fisherman. We <b><b>have no</b> idea</b> how it got there but it’s been<b> polished </b>and proudly restored to its original place on the boat. Please <b>take care</b> <b>going down</b> the ladders if you wish to visit the lower deck – we don’t recommend you allow <b>young children</b> to use them. (Q20)","So we hope you have a memorable visit to <b>Manham Port</b> and will tell your friends all about us.","#3 Laura’s <b>work placement</b> Transcript","The Part 3 <b>audio transcript</b> of Laura’s <b>work placement</b> in Cambridge 10 <b>Listening Test</b> 4 is as follows:","TIM:                      Hi, Laura – could you <b>spare a <b>few minutes</b></b> to talk about the <b>work placement</b> you <b>did last</b> summer? I’m <b>thinking of doing</b> one myself …","LAURA:                Hi, Tim. Sure.","TIM:                      Didn’t you do yours at an environmental services company?","LAURA:                That’s right … It’s only a very <b>small company</b> and they needed someone to produce a company brochure, and I <b>wanted to get</b> some business experience because I’m <b>interested in a career</b> in<b> occupational </b>psychology in a business environment. It was good <b>because I had</b> overall<b> responsibility </b>for the project.","TIM:                      What kind of skills <b>do you think</b> you developed on the placement? I mean, apart from the ones you <b>already had</b> … <b>Did you have</b> to <b>do all</b> the artwork for the brochure, the layout and everything?","LAURA:                We hired the services of a professional photographer for that. I did <b>have to use</b> my IT skills to a certain extent because I cut and pasted text from marketing leaflets, but that didn’t involve anything I hadn’t done before.","TIM:                      <b>Do you think</b> you <b>got any</b> better at managing your time and<b> prioritizing </b>things? You always used to say you had trouble with that … (Q21&Q22)","LAURA:                Oh, definitely. There was so much pressure to meet the project deadline. And I <b>also got</b> better at <b>explaining things</b> and asserting my opinions (Q21&Q22), <b>because I had</b> to have weekly consultations with the marketing manager and <b>give him</b> a progress report.","TIM:                      It sounds as if you <b>got a lot</b> out of it then.","LAURA:                Absolutely. It was really worthwhile … But you know, the company benefited too …","TIM:                      Yes, they must <b>have done</b>. After all, if they’d used a professional advertising agency to produce their brochure instead of doing it in-house,<b> presumably </b>they’d have paid a lot more?","LAURA:                Oh, yes. I worked it out – it would have been 250 <b>per cent</b> more (Q23&Q24). And I thought the end result was good, <b>even though</b> we did everything on site. The <b>company has</b> quite a powerful computer and I managed to borrow some<b> scanning </b>software from the university. The new brochure looks really professional; it enhances the image of the company <b>straight away</b> (Q23&Q24).","TIM:                      So in the <b>long run</b> it should help them to attract clients, and improve their <b>sales figures</b>?","LAURA:                That’s the idea. Yeah.","———————–","TIM:                      Well, all in all it sounds <b>very positive</b> – I think I will <b>go ahead</b> and apply for a placement myself. How do I go about it?","LAURA:                It’s <b>easy enough</b> to do, because there’s a government agency called STEP – S-T-E-P – that organises placements for students. You should start by getting their booklet with all the details – I expect you can download one from their website.","TIM:                      Actually, they’ve got copies in the<b> psychology </b>department – I’ve seen them there. I’ll <b>just go</b> to the office and pick one up. (Q25)","LAURA:                Right. And then if I were you, after I’d looked at it I’d go over all the options with someone …","TIM:                      I suppose I should ask my tutor’s advice. He knows more about me than anyone.","LAURA:                One of the career officers would be better (Q26), they’ve got more knowledge about the jobs market than your personal tutor would have.","TIM:                      OK …","LAURA:                And then when you <b>know what you want</b> you can register with STEP – you’ll find their address in the booklet. And once you’ve registered they assign you to a mentor who looks after your application.","TIM:                      And then I suppose you <b><b>just sit</b> back</b> and wait till you <b>hear something</b>?","LAURA:                They <b>told me</b> at the <b>careers office</b> that it’s best to be proactive, and <b>get up</b>dates yourself by checking the website for new placement alerts (Q27). Your mentor is supposed to keep you informed, but you can’t rely on that.","TIM:                      I don’t suppose it’s a <b>good idea</b> to <b>get in touch</b> with companies directly, is it?","LAURA:                Not really … But it is the company who notifies you if they want you to go for an interview. You get a letter of invitation or an email from<b> personnel </b>departments. (Q28)","TIM:                      And do I reply directly to them?","LAURA:                Yes, you do. STEP only <b>gets involved</b> again once you’ve been made a <b>job offer</b>.","TIM:                      Right … So, once you’ve had an interview you should let your mentor know what the outcome is? I mean whether you’re offered a job, and whether you’ve decided to accept it? (Q29)","LAURA:                That’s right. They’ll inform the <b>careers office</b> once a placement has been agreed, so you don’t <b>have to do</b> that.","TIM:                      Is that all then?","LAURA:                More or less. <b>Only once</b> you’ve accepted an offer you’ll <b>probably have</b> to supply a reference, because the placement will be conditional on that. And that’s something you should ask your own tutor to provide (Q3). He knows about your academic ability and also about your qualities, like reliability.","TIM:                      Well, <b><b>thanks very</b> much</b> for the information – I’m starting to <b>look forward</b> …","#4 <b>Nanotechnology Transcript</b>","The Part 4 <b>audio transcript</b> of Nanotechnology-Technology on a small scale in Cambridge 10 <b>Listening Test</b> 4 is as follows:","Today we’re <b>going to <b>look at an important</b></b> area of science, namely nanotechnology. So what is it? Nano means tiny, so it’s science and engineering on the scale of atoms and molecules. The idea is that by controlling and<b> rearranging </b>atoms, you can literally <b>create anything</b>. However, as we’ll see, the science of the small <b>has some</b> big implications affecting us in <b>many ways</b>.","There’s <b>no doubt</b> that<b> nanotechnology </b>promises so much for civilisation. However, all <b>new technologies</b> have their teething problems. And with nanotechnology, society <b>often gets</b> the wrong idea about its capabilities (Q31).","Numerous science-fiction books and movies have raised people’s fears about<b> nanotechnology </b>– with<b> scenarios </b>such as inserting little nano-robots into your body that monitor everything you do without you realising it, or self-replicating nano-robots that eventually take over the world.","So how do we<b> safeguard </b>such a potentially powerful technology? <b>Some scientists</b> recommend that nano-particles be treated as <b>new chemicals</b> with separate safety tests and clear labelling (Q32). They believe that greater care should also be taken with nano-particles in<b> laboratories </b>and factories. Others <b>have called</b> for a<b> withdrawal </b>of new nano <b>products such</b> as<b> cosmetics </b>and a<b> temporary </b>halt to <b>many kinds</b> of<b> nanotech </b>research.","But as far as I’m concerned there’s a need to<b> plough </b>ahead with the discoveries and applications of<b> nanotechnology </b>(Q33). I really believe that <b>most scientists</b> would welcome a way to guard against unethical uses of such technology.","We can’t go around thinking that all innovation is bad, all advancement is bad. As with the debate about any <b>new technology</b>, it is how you use it that’s important. So let’s <b>look at some</b> of its possible uses.","————————–","Thanks to nanotechnology, there could be a major breakthrough in the field of transportation with the production of more durable metals (Q34). These could be virtually unbreakable, lighter and much more<b> pliable </b>leading to planes that are 50 times lighter than at present.","Those same improved capabilities will <b>dramatically reduce</b> the cost of travelling into space making it more accessible to <b>ordinary people</b> (Q35) and opening up to totally new holiday destination.","In terms of technology, the computer industry will be able to<b> shrink </b>computer parts down to minute sizes. We need<b> nanotechnology </b>in order to create a <b>new generation</b> of computers that will work even faster and will have a million times more memory but will be about the size of a sugar cube (Q36).<b> Nanotechnology </b>could also <b>revolutionise the way</b> that we generate power.","The cost of solar cells will be<b> drastically </b>reduced so harnessing this energy will be far more economical than at present. (Q37)","But<b> nanotechnology </b>has <b>much wider</b> applications than this and could have an <b>enormous impact</b> on our environment. For instance, tiny airborne nano-robots could be programmed to actually rebuild the<b> ozone </b>layer, which could lessen the impact of <b>global warming</b> on our planet.","That’s a pretty amazing thought, isn’t it? On a more local scale, this <b>new technology</b> could help with the clean-up of environmental disasters as<b> nanotechnology </b>will allow us to remove oil and other<b> contaminants </b>from the water far more effectively (Q38).","And, if<b> nanotechnology </b>progresses as expected – as a sort of <b>building block</b> set of about 90 atoms – then you could build anything you wanted from the bottom up. In terms of production, this means that you <b>only use</b> what you need and so there wouldn’t be any waste. (Q39)","The notion that you could <b>create anything</b> at all has major implications for our health. It means that we’ll eventually be able to<b> replicate </b>anything. This would have a<b> phenomenal </b>effect on our society. In time it could even <b>lead to the eradication</b> of famine through the introduction of machines that produce <b>food to feed</b> the hungry.","But it’s in the area of medicine that<b> nanotechnology </b>may have its biggest impact. How we detect disease will change as tiny<b> biosensors </b>are developed to analyse tests in minutes rather than days (Q40). There’s even<b> speculation </b>nano-robots could be <b>used to slow</b> the ageing process,<b> lengthening </b><b>life expectancy</b>.","As you can see, I’m very excited by the implications that could be available to us in the next <b>few decades</b>.

This open-air museum gives you the experience of agriculture and rural life in the English countryside at the <b>end of the nineteenth</b> century. So you’ll see a typical farm of that period, and <b>like me</b>, <b>all the staff</b> are dressed in clothes of that time.","<b>I </b> must <b>give you some</b> advice and safety tips before we go <b>any further</b>. As it’s a working farm, <b>please do</b>n’t<b> frighten </b>or injure the animals (Q11). We <b>have a lot</b> here, and many of them are breeds that are now <b>quite rare</b>.","And do stay at a safe distance from the tools: <b>some of them have</b> sharp points which can be pretty dangerous, so <b>please do</b>n’t touch them (Q12). We don’t <b>want any</b> accidents, do we?","The <b>ground is very</b> uneven, and you might<b> slip </b>if you’re wearing<b> sandals </b>so I’m <b>glad to see</b> you’re all wearing shoes – we always advise people to do that. (Q13)","Now, <b><b>children of all</b> ages</b> are <b>very welcome</b> here, and usually even very <b>young children</b> love the ducks and lambs, so do bring them along <b>next time</b> you come.","<b>I </b> don’t think any of you <b>have brought</b> dogs with you, but in case you have, I’m afraid they’ll have to stay in the <b>car park</b> unless they’re guide dogs (Q14). I’m sure you’ll understand that they could cause a <b>lot of problems</b> on a farm.","Now <b>let <b>me <b>give you some</b></b></b> idea of the layout of the farm. The building where you bought your tickets is the New Barn, immediately to your right, and we’re now at the beginning of the <b>main path</b> to the farmland – and of course the <b>car park</b> is on your left. The<b> scarecrow </b>you can see in the <b>car park</b> in the corner, beside the <b>main path</b> (Q15), is a traditional figure for keeping the <b>birds away</b> from crops, but our<b> scarecrow </b>is a permanent sculpture. It’s taller than a human being, so you can see it from <b>quite a distance</b>.","If you look ahead of you, you’ll see a maze. It’s<b> opposite </b>the New Barn, beside the <b>side path</b> that branches off to the <b>right just</b> over there (Q16). The<b> maze </b>is made out of<b> hedges </b>which are too tall for <b>young children</b> to see over them, but it’s <b>quite small</b>, so you can’t <b>get lost</b> in it!","Now, can you see the bridge crossing the fish pool further up the <b>main path</b>? If you <b>want to go</b> to the café, go towards the bridge and turn <b>right just</b> before it. Walk along the <b>side path</b> and the café’s on the first bend you come to (Q17). The building was originally the schoolhouse, and it’s well over a <b>hundred years</b> old.","As you may know, we run skills workshops here, where you can learn traditional<b> crafts </b>like woodwork and basket-making. You can see examples of the work, and talk to someone about the courses, in the <b>Black Barn</b>. If you take the <b>side path</b> to the right, here, just by the New Barn, you’ll come to the <b>Black Barn</b> just where the path first bends. (Q18)","Now I mustn’t <b>forget to tell</b> you about picnicking, as I can see <b>some of you have</b> brought your lunch with you. You can picnic in the field, though do <b>clear up</b> behind you, of course. Or if you’d prefer a <b>covered picnic</b> area, there’s one near the farmyard: just after you cross the bridge, there’s a <b>covered picnic</b> spot on the right. (Q19)","And the <b>last thing</b> to mention is Fiddy House itself. From here you can cross the bridge then walk along the footpath through the field to the left of the farmyard. That goes to the house (Q20), and it’ll give you a <b>lovely view</b> of it. It’s certainly worth a few photographs, but as it’s a private home, I’m afraid you can’t go inside.","Right. Well, if you’re all ready, we’ll set off on our tour of the farm.","#3 <b>Study on <b>gender in Physics</b></b> Transcript","The Part 3 <b>audio transcript</b> of <b>Study on <b>gender in Physics</b></b> in Cambridge 11 <b>Listening Test</b> 1 is as follows:","LISA:      OK, Greg, so I finally managed to read the article you mentioned – the one about the <b>study on <b>gender in physics</b></b>.","GREG:    About the study of <b>college students</b> done by Akira Miyake and his team? Yeah. I was interested that the researchers were actually a mix of<b> psychologists </b>and physicists. That’s an<b> unusual </b>combination.","LISA:      Yeah. I got a little confused at first about which students the study was based on. They weren’t actually majoring in<b> physics </b>– they were majoring in what’s known as the<b> STEM </b>disciplines. That’s science, technology, engineering and … (Q21)","GREG:    … and math. Yes, but they were all doing <b>physics courses</b> as part of their studies.","LISA:      That’s correct. So as I understood it, Miyake and co started from the fact that women are<b> underrepresented </b>in<b> introductory </b><b>physics courses</b> at college, and also that on average, the women who do enrol on these courses perform more poorly than the men. <b>No <b>one <b><b>really know</b>s</b></b></b> why this is the case.","GREG:    Yeah. But what the researchers <b>wanted to find</b> out was basically what they could do about the relatively low level of the women’s results (Q22). But in order to <b>find a solution</b> they needed to find out more about the nature of the problem.","LISA:      Right – <b>now let</b>’s see if I can remember … it was that in the<b> physics </b>class, the <b>female students</b> thought the male students all assumed that women weren’t any good at<b> physics </b>… was that it? And they thought that the men expected them to <b>get <b>poor results</b></b> in their tests.","GREG:    That’s what the women thought, and that made them nervous, so they did <b>get <b>poor results</b></b>. But actually they were wrong … <b>No one</b> was <b>making any</b> assumption about the <b>female students</b> at all. (Q23)","LISA:      Anyway, what Miyake’s team did was quite simple – getting the students to <b>do some</b> writing before they went into the<b> physics </b>class. What did they call it?","GREG:    Values-affirmation – they had to write an essay focusing on things that were significant to them, not particularly to do with the subject they were studying, but more general <b>things like</b> music or people who mattered to them. (Q24)","LISA:      Right. So the idea of <b>doing the writing</b> is that this gets the students thinking in a positive way.","GREG:    And putting these thoughts into words can relax them and help them overcome the<b> psychological </b>factors that lead to poor performance (Q25). Yeah. But what the researchers in the study hadn’t expected was that this one activity raised the women’s<b> physics </b>grades from the C to the B range. (Q26)","LISA:      A huge change. Pity it wasn’t to an A, but still! No, but it <b>does suggest</b> that the women were seriously underperforming beforehand, in comparison with the men.","GREG:    Yes. Mind you, Miyake’s article left out a lot of details. Like, <b>did the students</b> to the writing just once, or <b>several times</b>? And had they been told why they were <b>doing the writing</b>? That might <b>have affected</b> the results. (Q27)","LISA:      You mean, if they know the researchers thought it might help them to improve, then they’d just try to<b> fulfil </b>that expectation?","GREG:    Exactly.","——————-","GREG:    So anyway, I thought for our project we could do a similar study, but investigate whether it really was the writing activity that had that result.","LISA:      OK. So we could ask them to do a <b>writing task</b> about something <b>completely different</b> … something more factual? Like a <b>general knowledge</b> topic.","GREG:    Maybe … or we could have half the students doing a <b>writing task</b> and half <b><b>doing some</b>thing</b> else, like an oral task.","LISA:      Or even, half <b>do the same</b> <b>writing task</b> as in the original research and <b>half do</b> a<b> factual </b><b>writing task</b> (Q28). Then we’d see if it really is the topic that made the difference, or something else.","GREG:    That’s it. Good. So at our meeting with the<b> supervisor </b>on Monday we can tell him we’ve decided on our project. We should have our aims ready by then. I suppose we need to read the original study – the article’s just a summary.","LISA:      And these was <b>another article</b> I read, by Smolinsky. It was about her research on how <b>women and men</b> perform in mixed teams in class, compared with single-sex teams and on their own.","GREG:    <b>Let <b>me guess</b></b> … the women were better at teamwork.","LISA:      That’s what I expected, but actually the men and the women got the same results whether they were working in teams or on their own (Q29). But I guess it’s not that<b> relevant </b>to us.","GREG:    What worries me anyway is how we’re going to <b>get everything</b> done in the time.","LISA:      We’ll be OK now we know what we’re doing. Though I’m not clear how we assess whether the students in our experiment <b>actually make</b> any progress or not …","GREG:    No. We may need <b>some advice</b> on that. The <b>main thing</b>’s to <b>make sure</b> we <b>have the right</b> size sample, not too big or <b>too small</b>.","LISA:      That shouldn’t be difficult. Right, what <b><b>do we need</b> to do</b> next? We could <b>have a look</b> at the timetable for the science classes … or perhaps we should just <b>make an appointment</b> to <b>see one</b> of the science professors. That’d be better. (Q30)","GREG:    Great. And we could <b>even get</b> to observe one of the classes.","LISA:      What for?","GREG:    Well … OK maybe let’s <b>just go</b> with your idea. Right, well …","#4 <b>Ocean Biodiversity</b> Transcript","The Part 4 <b>audio transcript</b> of <b>Ocean Biodiversity</b> in Cambridge 11 <b>Listening Test</b> 1 is as follows:","I’ve been looking at <b>ocean biodiversity</b>, that’s the <b>diversity of species</b> that live in the world’s oceans. About 20 <b>years ago</b> biologists <b>developed the idea</b> of what they called ‘biodiversity hotspots’. These are the areas which have the greatest mixture of species, so <b>one example</b> is Madagascar. These<b> hotspots </b>are significant because they allow us to locate <b>key areas</b> for focusing efforts at conservation (Q31). Biologists can identify<b> hotspots </b>on land, fairly easily, but <b>until recently</b>, <b>very little</b> was known about<b> species </b>distribution and diversity in the oceans, and <b>no one</b> even knew if<b> hotspots </b>existed there.","Then a Canadian <b>biologist called</b> Boris Worm did <b>some research</b> in 2005 on data on ocean<b> species </b>that he got from the <b>fishing industry</b>. Worm located five<b> hotspots </b>for large ocean predators like sharks, and looked at what they <b>had in common</b>. The <b>main thing</b> he’d expected to find was that they had <b>very high</b><b> concentrations </b>of food, but to his surprise that was only true for four of the<b> hotspots </b>– the remaining<b> hotspots </b>was quite badly off in that regard (Q32).","But what he <b>did find</b> was that in all cases, the water at the surface of the ocean had relatively high temperatures, even when it was cool at <b>greater depths</b> (Q33), so this seemed to be a factor in supporting a <b>diverse range</b> of these <b>large predators</b>. However, this wasn’t enough on its own, because he <b>also found</b> that the water needed to <b>have enough</b><b> oxygen </b>in it (Q34) – so these <b>two factors</b> seemed necessary to support the high<b> metabolic </b>rate of these large fish.","<b>A </b> <b>couple of years</b> later, in 2007, a researcher called Lisa Balance, who was working in California, also <b>started looking</b> for ocean hotspots, but not for fish – what she was interested in was marine mammals, <b>things like</b><b> seals </b>(Q35). And she found three places in the oceans which were hotspots, and what these <b>had in common</b> was that these<b> hotspots </b>were all located at boundaries between ocean currents, and this seems to be the sort of place that has lots of the<b> plankton </b>that <b>some of these species</b> feed on.","So now people who <b>want to protect</b> the<b> species </b>that are endangered <b>need to get</b> as <b>much information</b> as possible. For example, there’s an international <b>project called</b> the Census of Marine Life. They’ve been surveying oceans <b>all over the world</b>, including the Arctic. <b>One thing</b> they found there which<b> stunned </b><b>other researchers</b> was that there were <b>large <b>numbers of species</b></b> which live below the ice (Q36) – sometimes under a layer up to 20 metres thick.","<b>Some of these species</b> <b>had never</b> been seen before. They’ve <b>even found</b><b> species </b>of<b> octopus </b>living in these conditions. And <b>other scientists</b> working on the same project, but researching <b>very different</b><b> habitats </b>on the ocean floor, <b>have found</b> <b>large <b>numbers of species</b></b><b> congregating </b>around volcanoes, attracted to them by the warmth and nutrients there.","——————–","However, biologists still don’t know how serious the <b>threat to their survival</b> is for <b>each individual</b> species. So a body called the Global <b>Marine Species</b> Assessment is now creating a list of <b>endangered species</b> on land, so they consider <b>things like</b> the size of the population – how <b>many members</b> of <b>one species</b> there are in a particular place – and then they look at their distribution in<b> geographical </b>terms, although this is <b>quite difficult</b> when you’re looking at fish, because they’re so mobile, and then thirdly they calculate the rate at which the decline of the<b> species </b>is happening. (Q37)","So far only 1,500 <b>species have</b> been assessed, but they <b>want to increase</b> this figure to 20,000. For <b>each one</b> they assess, they use the data they collect on that<b> species </b>to produce a map showing its distribution (Q38). Ultimately they will be <b>able to use</b> these to figure out not only where most<b> species </b>are located but also where they are most threatened.","So finally, what can be done to retain the <b>diversity of species</b> in the world’s oceans? Firstly, we <b>need to set</b> up more<b> reserves </b>in our oceans, places where <b>marine species</b> are protected. We <b>have some</b>, but not enough. In addition, to<b> preserve </b><b>species such</b> as<b> leatherback </b>turtles, which live out in the high seas but have their nesting sites on the American coast, we need to create corridors for migration, so they can get from <b>one area</b> to another safely.","As well as this, action <b>needs to be taken</b> to lower the levels of fishing<b> quotas </b>to prevent<b> overfishing </b>of <b>endangered species</b>. And finally, there’s the problem of ‘by-catch’. This<b> prefers </b>to the catching of unwanted fish by <b>fishing boats</b> – they’re returned to the sea, but they’re often dead or dying. If these commercial <b>fishing boats</b> used equipment which was more selective, so that only the fish wanted for consumption were caught, this problem could be overcome.","OK. So does anyone <b>have any</b> …"]},{"name":"ALS/11-2","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Enquiry about joining Youth council Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of <b><b><b>Enquiry about joining</b> Youth</b> council</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 2 is as follows:","CAROLINE:          <b>Good Morning</b>. <b>Youth Council</b>.

Great to see you! I’m Jody, and I’ll be look after both of you for the first month you’re <b>working here</b> at the Amersham Theatre. I’ll <b>tell you something</b> about the theatre now, then take you to meet two of the other staff.","It’s an old building, and it’s been<b> modernised </b><b>several times</b>. In fact, as you can see, we’re carrying out a <b>major refurbishment</b> at the moment. The interior <b>has just</b> been repainted, and we’re about to start on the<b> exterior </b>of the building – that’ll be a big job. The work’s running over budget, so we’ve had to postpone installing an elevator. I hope you’re happy running <b>up and down</b> stairs! When the theatre was built, <b>people were generally</b><b> slimmer </b>and shorter than now, and the seats were <b>very close</b> together. We’ve replaced them with larger seats, with more legroom. This means fewer seats in total, but we’ve taken the opportunity to install seats that can easily be moved (Q11&Q12), to create different acting spaces. We’ve also turned a few<b> storerooms </b>over to <b>other purposes</b> like using them for meetings. (Q11&Q12)","We try hard to involve <b>members of the public</b> in the theatre. <b>One way</b> is by organising<b> backstage </b>tours so people can be shown round the building and learn how a theatre operates. These are <b><b>proving very</b> popular</b> (Q13&14). What we’re finding is that people <b>want to have</b> lunch or a <b>cup of coffee</b> while they’re here, so we’re looking into the possibility of opening a café in due course. We have a bookshop, which specialises in books about drama and that attracts plenty of customers (Q13&Q14).","Then there are two large rooms that will be decorated <b>next month</b>, and they’ll be available for hire, for conferences and private functions, such as parties. We’re also considering hiring out costumes to amateur drama clubs.","Now I <b>want to tell</b> you about our workshops. We recently started a programme of workshops that anyone can join. Eventually we intend to run courses in acting, but we’re waiting until we’ve got the <b>right people</b> in place as trainers. That’s proving more difficult than we’d expected! There’s a big demand to learn about the technical side of putting on a production, and our lighting workshop has <b>already started</b> with <b>great success</b> (Q15&Q16).","We’re <b>going to start</b> one on sound <b>next month</b>. A <b>number of people</b> have enquired about workshops on make-up, and that’s something we’re considering for the future. A surprise success is the workshop on making puppets – we <b>happen to have</b> someone <b>working here</b> who does it as a hobby, and she offered to run a workshop. It was so popular we’re now running them <b>every month</b>! (Q15&Q16)","Now, a word about the layout of the building. The auditorium, stage and <b>dressing rooms</b> for the actors are all below <b>ground level</b>. Here on the <b>ground floor</b> we have most of the rooms that the public doesn’t see. The majority are internal, so they have windows in the roof to light them.","Standing here in the foyer, you’re probably wondering why the <b>box office</b> isn’t here, where the public would <b>expect to find</b> it. Well, you might <b><b>have no</b>ticed</b> it on your way in – although it’s part of this building, it’s <b>next door</b> with a separate <b>entrance from the road</b>. (Q17)","For the theatre manager’s office, you go across the<b> foyer </b>and through the double doors, <b>turn right</b>, and it’s the room at the end of the corridor, with the door on the left. (Q18)","The <b>lighting box</b> is where the computerised stage lighting is operated and it’s at the back of the building. When you’re through the double doors turn left, <b>turn right</b> at the water cooler, and right again at the end. It’s the <b>second room</b> along that corridor (Q19). The <b>lighting box</b> has a window into the auditorium, which of course is below us.","The artistic director’s office is through the double doors, <b>turn right</b> and it’s the first <b>room you come</b> to on the right-hand side (Q20).

Didn’t Mr Blake make a<b> fuss </b>about us leaving that behind. (Q22)","COLIN:                 Yeah. He does go on. Anyway it was <b>easy to get</b> one from another of the students.","HELEN:                 Now, the next section’s the procedure. I sent you the draft of that.","COLIN:                 Yeah. It was clear, but I don’t <b>think we need</b> all these details of what time we left and what time we <b>got back</b> and how we <b>divided up</b> the different research tasks. (Q23)","HELEN:                 OK. I’ll look at that again.","COLIN:                 Then we have to describe our method of investigation in detail. So let’s begin with how we measured wave speed. I was surprised how<b> straightforward </b>that was. (Q24)","HELEN:                 I’d expected us to <b><b>have some</b> sort</b> of high-tech device, not just stand there and count the number of waves <b>per minute</b>. Not very precise, but I suppose it was <b>good enough</b>. But the way we measured the amount of salt was interesting.","COLIN:                 In the water from the <b>rock pools</b>?","HELEN:                 Yeah, oh, I wanted to check the chemicals we used in the lab when we analysed those samples – was it<b> potassium </b>chromate and silver nitrate?","COLIN:                 That’s right.","HELEN:                 OK. And we need the map of the seashore. You just left that to me. And I <b>had to do</b> in while the tide was low, well that was OK, but the place I started it from was down on the beach, then I realised I should <b>have gone</b> up higher to get better visibility (Q25), so I had to start <b>all over again</b>. But at least I’d go the squared paper or I’d have <b>had problems</b> drawing it all to scale.","COLIN:                 Yes. It looks good. We could get a map of the region off the internet and see if we <b>need to make</b> <b>any changes</b>.","HELEN:                 I <b>had a look</b> but I couldn’t <b>find anything</b>. But you <b>took some</b> pictures, didn’t you?","COLIN:                 Yeah. I’ll email you them if you want.","HELEN:                 OK. I’ll make my amendments using those, then I can scan it into our report (Q26). Great.","HELEN:                 Now when we get to our findings I thought we could divide them up into the different zones we identified on the shore and the problems organisms face in each zone. So for the highest area …","COLIN:                 … the<b> splash </b>zone?","HELEN:                 Yeah, we found mostly those tiny<b> shellfish </b>that have strong hard shells that act as protection.","COLIN:                 But not from other organisms that might eat them, predators?","HELEN:                 No, that’s not the main danger for them. But the shells prevent them from drying out because they’re in the <b>open air</b> for <b>most of the time</b>. (Q27&Q28)","COLIN:                 Right. And since they’ve exposed, they <b>need to be able</b> to <b>find some</b> sort of shelter, or cover themselves up, so they don’t <b>get too</b> hot (Q27&Q28). Then in the <b>middle and lower</b> zones, nearer the sea, we need to discuss the effects of wave action …","HELEN:                 Yes, and how organisms develop structures to prevent themselves from being<b> swept </b>away, or even destroyed by being<b> smashed </b>against the rocks.","COLIN:                 I haven’t done anything on the<b> geological </b>changes. I don’t know what to put for that.","HELEN:                 No, we weren’t<b> concentrating </b>on that. Maybe we <b><b>need to find</b> some</b> websites.","COLIN:                 <b>Good idea</b>. I’ve got the lecture notes from Mr Blake’s<b> geology </b>course, but they’re too general. But we could <b>ask him</b> which books on our <b>Reading List</b> might be most helpful.","HELEN:                 Right. OK, now I did a draft of the section of sources of possible error in our research, but I don’t know if you agree. For example, the size of the sample, and whether it’s <b>big enough</b> to <b>make any</b> general conclusions from. But I thought actually we <b>did have</b> <b>quite a big</b> sample.","COLIN:                 We did. And our general method of observation seemed quite reliable. But we might not be all that <b>accurate as far</b> as the actual numbers go.","HELEN:                 Yeah, we might have missed some organisms – if they were hiding under a rock, for example (Q29&Q30). I wasn’t sure about the way we described their habitats. I decided it was probably OK.","COLIN:                 Yeah, and the descriptions we gave of the smaller organisms, they weren’t very detailed, but they were adequate in this context. I’m not sure we identified <b>all the species</b> correctly thought. (Q29&Q30)","HELEN:                 OK, we’d better mention that. Now, how …","#4 <b><b><b>Designing Taylor</b> Concert</b> Hall</b> Transcript","The Part 4 <b>audio script</b> of <b><b><b>Designing Taylor</b> Concert</b> Hall</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 2 is as follows:","We’ve been discussing the factors the architect has to consider when designing domestic buildings. I’m going to <b>move on now</b> to consider the design of public buildings, and I’ll illustrate this by<b> referring </b>to the <b>new <b><b>Taylor Concert</b> Hall</b></b> that’s recently been completed <b>here in the city</b>.","So, as with a domestic building, when designing a public building, an <b>architect needs</b> to consider the function of the building – for example, is it to be used primarily for entertainment, or for education, or for administration? The second thing the <b>architect needs</b> to think about is the context of the building, this includes its physical location obviously, but it <b>also includes</b> the<b> social </b>meaning of the building how it relates to the people it’s built for (Q31).","And finally, for important public buildings, the architect may also be looking for a central<b> symbolic </b>idea on which to base the design, a sort of<b> metaphor </b>for the building and the way in which it is used.","Let’s look at the <b>new <b><b>Taylor Concert</b> Hall</b></b> in relation to these ideas. The location chosen was a site in a run-down district that has been ignored in previous<b> redevelopment </b>plans. It was occupied by a factory that had been empty for <b>some years</b> (Q32). The <b>whole area</b> was <b>some distance</b> from the high-rise office blocks of the central business district and shopping centre, but it was <b>only one</b> kilometre from the ring road. The side itself was bordered to the north by a canal (Q33) which had once been used by boats bringing in <b><b>raw material</b>s</b> when the area was used for manufacturing.","The architect chosen for the project was Tom Harrison. He found the main design challenge was the location of the site in an <b>area that had</b> no<b> neighbouring </b>buildings of <b>any importance</b>. To reflect the fact that the significance of the building in this quite run-down location was as yet unknown, he <b>decided to create</b> a building centred around the idea of a<b> mystery </b>– something whose meaning <b>still has</b> to be discovered.","So how was this reflected in the <b>design of the building</b>? Well, Harrison <b>decided to create</b><b> pedestrian </b>access to the building and to <b>make use</b> of the presence of water on the site. As <b>people approach</b> the entrance, they <b>therefore have</b> to cross over a bridge (Q34). He wanted to <b>give people</b> a feeling of<b> suspense </b>as they see the building first from a distance, and then close-up, and the initial impression he wanted to create from the shape of the building as a whole was that of a box (Q35).","The first side that <b>people see</b>, the southern wall, is just a high, <b>flat wall</b><b> uninterrupted </b>by any windows. This might sound off-putting, but it supports Harrison’s concept of the building – that the person approaching is<b> intrigued </b>and wonders what will be inside. And this <b>flat wall</b> <b>also has</b> another purpose. At night-time, projectors are switched on and it functions as a huge screen, onto which images are projected. (Q36)","The<b> auditorium </b>itself seats 1500 people. The floor’s supported by ten massive pads. These are constructed from rubber (Q37), and so are able to absorb any vibrations from outside and prevent them from affecting the auditorium. The walls are made of several layers of hony-coloured wood, all sourced from local beech trees. In order to improve the acoustic properties of the<b> auditorium </b>and to amplify the sound, they are not straight, they are curved (Q38).","The acoustics are also adjustable according to the size of<b> orchestra </b>and the type of music being played. In <b>order to achieve</b> this, there are nine movable panels in the ceiling above the<b> orchestra </b>which are all individually motorized, and the <b>walls also</b> have curtains which can be opened or closed to change the acoustics. (Q39)","The reaction of the public to the <b>new building</b> has generally been positive. However, the evaluation of some critics has been less enthusiastic. In<b> spite </b>of Harrison’s efforts to use local materials, they criticise the style of the design as being international rather than local (Q40), and say it doesn’t reflect features of the landscape or society for which it is built."]},{"name":"ALS/11-3","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Free activities in Burnham area Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of <b>Free <b><b>activities in Burnham</b> area</b></b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 3 is as follows:","MARTIN:              <b>Good morning</b>. This is Burnham tourist, Martin speaking.","SUE:                      Oh, hello. I <b>saw a poster</b> about free <b>things to do</b> in the area, and it said people should phone you for information. I’m coming to Burnham with my husband and <b>two children</b> for a <b>few days</b> on June the 27th, or possibly the 28th, and I’d like <b><b>some idea</b>s</b> for <b>things to do</b> on the 29th. (Example)","MARTIN:              Yes, of course. OK. Then let’s start with a couple of events especially for children. The <b>art gallery</b> is holding an event called ‘Family Welcome’ that day, when there are activities and<b> trails </b>to use throughout the gallery.","SUE:                      That <b>sounds interesting</b>. What time does it start?","MARTIN:              The gallery opens at 10, and the ‘Family Welcome’ event runs from 10.30 until 2 o’clock (Q1). The gallery stays open until 5. And <b>several times</b> <b>during the day</b>, they’re going to show a <b>short film</b> that the gallery <b>has produced</b>. It demonstrates how<b> ceramics </b>are made (Q2), and there’ll be equipment and materials for children to <b>have a go</b> themselves.","<b>Last time</b> they ran the event, there was a film about painting, which <b>went <b><b>down very</b> well</b></b> with the children, and they’re <b>now working</b> on one about sculpture.","SUE:                      I like the sound of that. And what other events happen in Burnham?","MARTIN:              Well, do you all enjoy <b>listening to music</b>?","SUE:                      Oh, yes.","MARTIN:              Well there are several free concerts <b>taking place</b> at different times – <b>one or two</b> in the morning, the majority at lunchtime (Q3), and a couple in the evening. And they range from pop music to <b>Latin American</b>.","SUE:                      The <b>Latin American</b> could be fun. What time is that?","MARTIN:              It’s being repeated <b>several times</b>, in <b>different places</b>. They’re performing in the central library at 1 o’clock, then at 4 it’s in the City Museum (Q4), and in the evening, at 7.30, there’s a longer concert, in the theatre.","SUE:                      Right. I’ll suggest that to the <b>rest of the family</b>.","MARTIN:              Something else you might be interested in is the boat race along the river.","SUE:                      Oh, yes, do <b>tell me</b> about that.","MARTIN:              The race starts at Offord Marina (Q5), to the north of Burnham, and goes as far as Summer Pool. The <b>best place</b> to watch it from is Charlesworth Bridge, though that <b>does get</b> rather crowded.","SUE:                      And who’s <b>taking part</b>?","MARTIN:              Well, local boat clubs, but the standard is <b>very high</b>.

It means that <b>next year</b> they’ll be representing the region in the national championship.","——————————","SUE:                      Now I’ve heard something about Paxton <b>Nature Reserve</b>. It’s a <b>good place</b> for spotting<b> unusual </b>birds, isn’t it? (Q7)","MARTIN:              That’s right – <b>throughout the year</b>. There is a lake there, as well as a river, and they provide a <b>very attractive</b> habitat. So it’s a <b>good idea</b> to bring<b> binoculars </b>if you have them. And just at the moment you can see various flowers that are pretty<b> unusual </b>(Q8) – the soil at Paxton isn’t <b>very common</b>. They’re looking good <b>right now</b>.","SUE:                      Right. My husband will be <b>particularly interested</b> in that.","MARTIN:              And there’s going to be a talk and slide show about mushrooms – and you’ll be able to go out and pick some afterwards and study the different varieties. (Q9)","SUE:                      Uhuh. And is it possible for <b>children to swim</b> in the river?","MARTIN:              Yes. Part of it has been fenced off to make it safe for <b>children to swim</b> in (Q10). It’s very shallow, and there’s a<b> lifeguard </b>on duty whenever it’s open. The lake is too deep, so swimming isn’t allowed there.","SUE:                      OK, we must remember to bring their swimming things, in case we go to Paxton.

Our first speaker is Shona Ferguson, from Barford <b>town council</b>. Shone.","SHONA:  Thank you. First I’ll briefly <b>give you some</b> background information, then I’ll be asking you for your comments on developments in the town.","Well, as you don’t need <b>me to tell</b> you, Barford <b>has changed</b> a <b>great deal</b> in the last 50 years. These are <b>some of the main</b> changes.","<b>Fifty years</b> ago, buses linked <b>virtually every</b> part of the town and the<b> neighbouring </b>towns and villages. <b>Most people</b> used them frequently, but not <b>now because</b> the bus companies<b> concentrate </b>on just the routes that attract most passengers. So parts of the town are <b>no longer</b> served by buses (Q11).","Even replacing old uncomfortable buses with smart <b>new ones</b> has <b>had little</b> impact on passenger numbers. It’s sometimes said that bus fares are too high, but in relation to average incomes, fares are not <b>much higher</b> than they were 50 <b>years ago</b>.","Changes in the road network are affecting the town. The centre was recently <b>closed to traffic</b> on a trial basis, making it much safer to pedestrians. The impact of this is being measured. The new <b>cycle path</b>s separating bikes from cars in most <b>main road</b>s, are being used far more than was expected reducing traffic and improving <b>air quality</b> (Q12). And although the council’s attempts to have a bypass constructed have failed, we haven’t <b>given up</b> hope of persuading the government to <b>change its mind</b>.","Shopping in the <b>town centre</b> <b>has changed</b> over the years. Many of us can remember when the town was crowded with people going shopping. Numbers have been falling for several years, despite efforts to attract shoppers, for instance by opening new <b><b>car park</b>s</b>. <b>some people</b> combine shopping with visits to the town’s <b>restaurants and cafés</b>. Most shops are small independent stores, which is good, but many <b>people prefer</b> to use supermarkets and <b>department stores</b> in nearby large towns, as there are so few well-known chain stores here. (Q13)","Turning how to medical facilities, the town is served by family doctors in several medical practices – fewer than 50 <b>years ago</b>, but each<b> catering </b>for far more patients. Our hospital closed 15 <b>years ago</b> (Q14), which means journeys to other towns are unavoidable.","On the other hand, there are more dentists than there used to be. Employment patterns <b>have changed</b>, along with <b>almost every</b>thing else. The <b>number of schools</b> and colleges <b>has increased</b> making that the main employment sector (Q15). Services, such as website design and accountancy, <b>have grown</b> in importance, and surprisingly, perhaps, manufacturing hasn’t seen the decline that has affected it in <b>other parts</b> of the country.","—————-","Now I’ll <b>very quickly</b> outline current plans for some of the town’s facilities, before asking for your comments.","As you’ll know if you regularly use the <b>car park</b> at the railway station, it’s usually full. The <b>railway company</b> applied for permission to replace it with a multi-storey <b>car park</b>, but that was refused. Instead, the <b>company has</b> bought some adjoining land, and this will be used to <b>increase the number</b> of <b>parking spaces</b>. (Q16)","The Grand, the <b>old cinema</b> in the <b>high street</b> will close at the <b>end of the year</b>, and reopen on a different site (Q17). You’ve <b>probably seen</b> the building under construction. The plan is to <b>have three</b> screens with fewer seats, rather than just the one large<b> auditorium </b>in the <b>old cinema</b>.","<b>I </b> expect many of you<b> shop </b>in the indoor market. It’s become more and more shabby-looking, and because of fears about safety, it was<b> threatened </b>with demolition. The <b>good news</b> is that it will close for sex weeks to be made safe and redecorated, and the <b>improved building</b> will open in July. (Q18)","<b>Lots of people</b> use the library, including <b><b>school and college</b> students</b> who go there to study. The <b>council has</b> managed to secure funding to keep the library open later into the evening, <b>twice a week</b> (Q19). We would like to enlarge the building in the not-too-distant future, but this is by no means definite.","There’s no limit on access to the <b>nature reserve</b> on the edge of town, and this will continue be the case. What will change, though, is that the council will <b>no longer</b> be in charge of the area. Instead it will become the<b> responsibility </b>of a national body that administers most <b>nature reserve</b>s in the country. (Q20)","OK, <b><b>now let</b> me</b> ask you …","#3 <b>Subject of drawing</b> Transcript","The Part 3 <b>audio transcript</b> of <b>Subject of drawing</b> in Cambridge 11 <b>Listening Test</b> 3 is as follows:","JEREMY:              Hello, Helen. Sorry I’m late.","HELEN:                 Hi, Jeremy, <b>no problem</b>. Well we’d better work out where we are on our project, I suppose.","JEREMY:              Yeah. I’ve looked at the drawings you’ve done for my story, ‘The Forest’, and I think they’re brilliant – they really create the atmosphere I had in mind when I was writing it.","HELEN:                 I’m glad you like them.","JEREMY:              T<b><b>here are just</b> a few</b> suggestions I’d <b>like to make</b>.","HELEN:                 <b>Go ahead</b>.","JEREMY:              Now, I’m not sure about the drawing of the cave – it’s got trees all around it (Q21), which is great, but the drawing’s a <b>bit too</b> static, isn’t it? I think it needs some action.","HELEN:                 Yes, there’s nothing happening. Perhaps I should add the boy – Malcolm, isn’t it? He would be walking up to it.","JEREMY:              Yes, let’s have Malcolm in the drawing. And what about putting in a tiger (Q22) – the one that he makes friends with a bit later? Maybe it could be sitting under a tree washing itself.","HELEN:                 And the tiger stops in the middle of what it’s doing when it sees Malcolm <b>walking past</b>.","JEREMY:              That’s a <b>good idea</b>.","HELEN:                 OK, I’ll <b>have a go</b> at that.","JEREMY:              Then there’s the drawing of the crowd of <b>men and women</b> dancing. They’re <b>just outside</b> the forest (Q23), and there’s a <b>lot going</b> on.","HELEN:                 That’s right, you wanted them to be watching a<b> carnival </b>procession, but I thought it would be too crowded. <b>Do you think</b> it works like this?","JEREMY:              Yes, I like what you’ve done. The <b>only thing</b> is, could you add Malcolm to it, without changing what’s already there.","HELEN:                 What about having him sitting on the tree trunk on the right of the picture?","JEREMY:              Yes, that would be fine.","HELEN:                 And <b>do you want</b> him watching the <b>other people</b>?","JEREMY:              No, he’s been left out of all the fun, so I’d <b>like him</b> to be crying (Q24) – that’ll contrast nicely with the next picture, where he’s laughing at the<b> clowns </b>in the carnival.","HELEN:                 Right, I’ll do that.","JEREMY:              And then the drawing of the people ice skating in the forest.","HELEN:                 I wasn’t too happy with that one. Because they’re supposed to be skating on grass aren’t they? (Q25)","JEREMY:              That’s right, and it’s frozen over. At the moment it doesn’t look quite right.","HELEN:                 Mm, I <b>see what you mean</b>. I’ll <b>have another</b> go at that.","JEREMY:              And I like the<b> wool </b>hats they’re wearing. Maybe you could give each of them a<b> scarf </b>as well. (Q26)","HELEN:                 Yeah, that’s <b>easy enough</b>. They can be streaming out behind the people to suggest they’re skating <b>really fast</b>.","JEREMY:              Mm, great. Well that’s all on the drawings.","HELEN:                 Right. So you’ve finished writing your story and I <b>just need</b> to finish illustrating it, and my story and your drawings are done.","———————–","HELEN:                 So the <b>next thing</b> is to decide what exactly we <b>need to write</b> about in the report that goes with the stories, and how we’re going to divide the work.","JEREMY:              Right, Helen.","HELEN:                 What <b>do you think</b> about including a section on how we planned the project as a whole, Jeremy? That’s probably quite important.","JEREMY:              Yeah. Well, you’ve had most of the <b><b>good idea</b>s</b> so far. How do you feel about drafting something (Q27), then we can go through it together and discuss it?","HELEN:                 OK, that seems reasonable. And I could <b>include something</b> on how we <b>came up</b> with the ideas for our two stories, couldn’t I?","JEREMY:              Well, I’ve started writing something about that, so why don’t you <b>do the same</b> and we can include the <b>two things</b>. (Q28)","HELEN:                 Right. So what about our<b> interpretation </b>of the stories? Do we <b>need to write</b> about what we think they show, like the value of <b>helping other</b> people, all that <b>sort of thing</b>?","JEREMY:              That’s going to <b>come up</b> later isn’t it? I think everyone in the class is going to read <b>each other</b>’s stories and <b>come up</b> with their own<b> interpretations </b>which we’re <b>going to discuss</b>. (Q29)","HELEN:                 Oh, I missed that. So it isn’t <b>going to be part</b> of the report at all?","JEREMY:              No. But we <b>need to write</b> about the illustrations, because they’re an essential element of children’s experience of reading the stories. It’s probably easiest for you to write that section, as you know more about drawing than I do.","HELEN:                 Maybe, but I find it <b>quite hard</b> to write about.

This is a <b>type of research</b> aimed at<b> exploring </b>the way <b>human cultures</b> work. It was <b>first developed</b> for use in anthropology, and it’s <b>also been used</b> in sociology and communication studies. So what’s it got to do with business, you may ask. Well, businesses are finding that<b> ethnography </b>can offer them <b>deeper insight</b> into the possible needs of customers, either present or future, as <b>well as providing</b> valuable information about their attitudes towards <b>existing products</b> (Q31). And<b> ethnography </b>can <b>also help</b> companies to design new <b>products or services</b> through <b><b>customer satisfaction</b> survey</b>s.","Let’s <b>look at <b>some examples</b></b> of how <b>ethnographic research</b> works in business. One <b>team of researchers</b> did a project for a company manufacturing kitchen equipment. They watched how cooks used <b>measuring cups</b> to measure out <b>things like</b> <b>sugar and flour</b>. They saw that the cooks <b>had to check</b> and recheck the contents, because although the <b>measuring cups</b> had numbers inside them, the cooks couldn’t see these easily (Q32). So a <b>new design</b> of cup was developed to overcome this problem, and it was a top seller.","<b>Another team</b> of <b>ethnographic research</b>ers looked at how cell phones were used in Uganda, in Africa. They <b>found that people</b> who didn’t <b>have their own</b> phones could pay to use the phones of local entrepreneurs. Because these customers paid in advance for their calls, they were eager to <b>know how much</b> time they’d spent on the call so far (Q33). So the phone company designed phones for use globally with this added feature.","<b>Ethnographic research</b> <b>has also</b> been carried out in computer companies. In one company, IT systems administrators were observed for several weeks. It was found that a <b>large amount</b> of their work involved communicating with colleagues in order to solve problems, but that they didn’t have a standard way of <b>exchanging information</b> from spreadsheets and so on. So the team <b>came up</b> with an idea for software that would help them to do this. (Q34)","In <b>another piece</b> of research, a team observed and talked to nurses working in hospitals. This led to the recognition that the nurses needed to access the computer records of their patients, <b>no matter</b> where they were (Q35). This <b>led to the development</b> of a portable computer tablet that allowed the nurses to check records in locations throughout the hospital.","Occasionally, research can be done even in environments where the researchers can’t be present. For example, in one project done for an airline,<b> respondents </b>used their smartphones to <b>record information</b> during airline trips, in a study aiming at tracking the emotions of passengers during a flight. (Q36)","———————","So what makes studies like these <b><b>different from ordinary</b> research</b>? Let’s <b>look at some</b> of the general<b> principles </b>behind <b>ethnographic research</b> in business. <b>First of all</b>, the researcher has to be completely open-minded – he or she hasn’t thought up a<b> hypothesis </b>to be tested, as is the case in <b>other types</b> of research. Instead they wait for the participants in the research to inform them.","As far as choosing the participants themselves is concerned, that’s not <b>really all</b> that <b><b>different from ordinary</b> research</b> – the criteria according to which the participants are chosen may be <b>something as simple</b> as the age bracket they fall into, or the researchers may select them according to their income (Q37), or they might try to find a set of people who all use a particular product, for example. But it’s absolutely crucial to<b> recruit </b>the <b>right people</b> as participants.","As well as the criteria I’ve mentioned, they have to be comfortable talking about themselves and being watched as they go about their activities (Q38). Actually, <b>most researchers</b> say that people <b>open up</b> pretty easily, maybe because they’re <b>often in their own</b> home of workplace.","So what makes this <b>type of research</b> special is that it’s not just a matter of sending a questionnaire to the participants, instead the research is usually based on first-hand observation of what they are doing at the time (Q39). But that doesn’t mean that the researcher never talks to the participants. However, unlike in traditional research, in this case it’s the participant rather than the researchers who decides what direction the interview will follow. This means that there’s less<b> likelihood </b>of the researcher<b> imposing </b>his or her own ideas on the participant.","But after they’ve said goodbye to their participants and <b>got back</b> to their office, the researchers’ work isn’t finished. <b>Most researchers</b><b> estimate </b>that 70 to 80 <b>per cent</b> of their time is spent not on the collecting of data but on its analysis – looking at photos listening to recording and<b> transcribing </b>them and so on (Q40). The researchers may <b>end up</b> with hundreds of pages of notes.","And to determine what’s significant, they don’t focus on the<b> sensational </b>things or the<b> unusual </b>things, instead they <b>try to identify</b> a pattern of <b>some sort</b> in all this data, and to discern the meaning behind it. This can result in some compelling insights that can in turn feed back to the <b>whole design</b> process."]},{"name":"ALS/11-4","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Stretton Festival Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of Stretton <b><b>Festival in Listening</b> Test</b> 4 is as follows:","ROB:                     <b>Good morning</b>.

My name’s Greg, and I’ll tell you about the various collections as we go round. But before we go, <b>let <b>me just</b></b> give you a taste of what we have here.","Well, for <b>one thing</b>, we have a <b>fine collection</b> of<b> twentieth </b>and twenty-<b>first century</b> paintings, many by <b>very well</b>-known artists. I’m sure you’ll recognise several of the paintings. This is the gallery that attracts the largest <b>number of visitors</b> (Q11), so it’s best to go in early in the day, before the crowds arrive.","The there are the nineteenth-century paintings. The museum was opened in the middle of that century, and several of the artists each donated one work (Q12) – to get the museum started, as it were. So they’re of special interest to us – we feel closer to them than to other works.","The<b> sculpture </b><b>gallery has</b> a number of fine exhibits, but I’m afraid it’s currently closed for refurbishment. You’ll need to come <b>back next</b> year to see it properly, but a number of the<b> sculptures </b>have been moved to <b>other parts</b> of the museum. (Q13)","‘A<b>round the world</b>’ is a<b> temporary </b>exhibition – you’ve <b>probably seen</b> something about it on TV or in the newspapers (Q14). It’s created a <b>great deal</b> of interest, because it presents objects from <b>every continent</b> and <b>many countries</b>, and provides information about their<b> social </b>context – why they were made, who for, and so on.","Then there’s the collection of coins. This is what you might call a focused,<b> specialist </b>collection, because all the coins come from this country, and were produced between <b>two thousand</b> and a <b>thousand years</b> ago. And many of them were discovered by <b>ordinary people</b><b> digging </b>their gardens and donated to the museum! (Q15)","All our<b> porcelain </b>and glass we left to the museum by its founder (Q16), when he died in 1878. And in the terms of his will, we’re not allowed to add anything to that collection: he believed it was perfect in itself, and we don’t see <b>any reason</b> to disagree!","——————–","OK, that was something about the collections, and now here’s some more practical information, in case you need it. Most of the museum<b> facilities </b>are downstairs, in the basement, so you <b>go down</b> the stairs here. When you <b>reach the bottom</b> of the stairs, you’ll <b>find yourself</b> in a sitting area, with comfortable chairs and sofas where you can <b>have a rest</b> before continuing your<b> exploration </b>of the museum.","We <b>have a very</b> good restaurant, which serves <b>excellent food</b> <b>all day</b>, in a relaxing atmosphere.

Now, before we discuss your new <b>research project</b>. I’d like to <b>hear something</b> about the <b>psychology study</b> you did <b>last year</b> for your Master’s degree. So how <b>did you choose</b> your subjects for that?","JOANNA:             Well, I had six subjects, all professional musicians, and all female. There were<b> violinists </b>and there was also a<b> cello </b>player and a<b> pianist </b>and a <b>flute player</b>. They were <b>all very</b> <b>highly regarded</b> in the music world and they’d done <b>quite extensive</b> tours in different<b> continents </b>(Q21&Q22), and <b>quite a few</b> had won prizes and competitions as well.","SUPERVISOR:      And they were quite young, weren’t they?","JOANNA:             Yes, between 25 and 29 – the mean was 27.8. I wasn’t specifically look for artists who’d produced recordings, but this is something that’s just <b>taken for granted</b> these days, and they <b>all had</b>. (Q21&Q22)","SUPERVISOR:      Right. Now you collected your data through telephone interviews, didn’t you?","JOANNA:             Yes. I realised if I was <b>going to interview</b> leading<b> musicians </b>it’s only be possible over the phone because they’re so busy (Q23&Q24). I recorded them using a telephone recording adaptor. I’d been worried about the quality, but it worked out <b>all right</b>. I managed at least a 30-minute interview with each subject, sometimes longer.","SUPERVISOR:      Did doing it on the phone make it more stressful?","JOANNA:             I’d thought it might … it was all quite informal though and in fact they seemed very keen to talk. And I don’t think using the phone meant I got less rich <b>data rather</b> the<b> opposite </b>in fact. (Q23&Q24)","SUPERVISOR:      Interesting. And you were looking at how performers dress for concert performances?","JOANNA:             That’s right. My research investigated the way players see their role as a<b> musician </b>and how this is linked to the type of clothing they decide to wear. But that focus didn’t<b> emerge </b>immediately. When I started I was more interested in trying to investigate the impact of what was worn on those listening (Q25&Q26), and <b>also whether</b> <b>someone like</b> a<b> violinist </b>might adopt a different style of clothing from, say, someone playing the flute or the<b> trumpet </b>(Q25&Q26).","SUPERVISOR:      It’s interesting that the <b>choice of dress</b> is up to the individual, isn’t it?","JOANNA:             Yes, you’d expect there to be rules about it in orchestras, but that’s <b>quite rare</b>.","——————————","SUPERVISOR:      You only had <b>women performers</b> in your study. Was that because male<b> musicians </b>are less worried about fashion?","JOANNA:             I <b>think a lot</b> of the men are <b>very much</b> influenced by fashion, but in <b>social terms</b> the choices they have are more limited … they’d <b>really up</b>set audiences if they<b> strayed </b>away from quite narrow boundaries. (Q27)","SUPERVISOR:      Hmm. Now, <b>popular music</b> has <b>quite different</b> expectations. <b>Did you read</b> Mike Frost’s article about the dress of <b>women performers</b> in <b>popular music</b>?","JOANNA:             No.","SUPERVISOR:      He points out that a lot of female singers and<b> musicians </b>in <b>popular music</b> tend to dress down in performances, and wear less<b> feminine </b>clothes, <b>like jeans</b> instead of skirts, and he suggests this is <b>beca<b>use other</b>wise</b> they’d just be discounted as trivial. (Q28)","JOANNA:             But you could argue they’re just wearing what’s practical … I mean, a pop-music concert is usually a pretty energetic affair.","SUPERVISOR:      Yes, he doesn’t make that point, but I think you’re <b>probably right</b>. I was interested by the effect of the audience at a musical performance when it came to the <b>choice of dress</b>.","JOANNA:             The subjects I interviewed felt this was <b>really important</b>. It’s <b>all to do</b> with what we understand by performance as a public event. They believed the audience had certain expectations and it was up to them as performers to<b> fulfil </b>these expectations to show a kind of<b> esteem </b>… (Q29)","SUPERVISOR:      … they weren’t afraid of looking as if they’d made an effort to <b>look good</b>.","JOANNA:             Mmm. I think in the past the audience would <b>have had</b> those expectation of <b>one another</b> too, but that’s not really the case now, not in the UK anyway.","SUPERVISOR:      No.","JOANNA:             And I also <b>got interested</b> in what sports scientists are doing too, with regard to clothing.","SUPERVISOR:     <b> Musicians </b>are quite<b> vulnerable </b>physically, aren’t they, because the movements they carry out are very intensive and repetitive, so I’d imagine some features of sports clothing could<b> safeguard </b>the players from the <b>potentially dangerous</b> effects of this <b>sort of thing</b>. (Q30)","JOANNA:             Yes, but<b> musicians </b>don’t really consider it. They avoid clothing that obviously restricts their movements, but that’s as far as they go.","SUPERVISOR:      Anyway, <b>coming back</b> to your own research, <b><b><b>do you have</b> any</b> idea</b> where you’re going from here?","JOANNA:             I was <b>thinking of doing</b> a study using an audience, including ..","#4 <b>Use of <b>soil to <b>reduce <b>carbon <b>dioxide in atmosphere</b></b></b></b></b> Transcript","The Part 4 <b>audio script</b> of The <b>Use of <b>soil to <b>reduce <b>carbon <b>dioxide in atmosphere</b></b></b></b></b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 4 is as follows:","As we saw in the last lecture, a major cause of <b>climate change</b> is the rapid rise in the level of <b>carbon <b>dioxide in the atmosphere</b></b> over the last century. If we could <b>reduce the amount</b> of CO2, perhaps the rate of <b>climate change</b> could also be slowed down. <b>One potential</b> method involves enhancing the role of the soil that <b>plants grow</b> in, with regard to absorbing CO2. Rattan Lal, a <b>soil scientist</b> from Ohio Stage University, in the USA, claims that the world’s agricultural soils could potentially absorb 13 <b>per cent</b> of the <b>carbon <b>dioxide in the atmosphere</b></b> – the equivalent of the amount released in the last 3o years. And <b>research is going</b> on into how this might be achieved.","Lal first came to the idea that soil might be valuable in this way not through an interest in <b>climate change</b>, but rather out of concern for the land itself and the people dependent on it. Carbon-rich soil is dark,<b> crumbly </b>and fertile, and retains <b>some water</b>. But erosion can occur if soil is dry (Q31), which is a likely effect if it contains<b> inadequate </b>amounts of carbon. Erosion is of course bad for people trying to grow crops or breed animals on that terrain. In the 1970s and ‘80s, Lal was studying soils in Africa so<b> devoid </b>of organic matter that the ground <b>had become</b> extremely hard (Q32), like cement. There he met a pioneer in the study of <b>global warming</b>, who suggested that <b>carbon from the soil</b> had moved into the atmosphere. This is now looking increasingly likely.","<b>Let me</b> explain. For <b>millions of years</b>, <b>carbon dioxide</b> levels in the atmosphere have been regulated, in part, by a natural partnership between plants and<b> microbes </b>– tiny organisms in the soil. Plants absorb CO2 from the air and transform it into sugars and other carbon-based substance (Q33). While a proportion of these carbon products remain in the plant, some transfer from the roots to<b> fungi </b>and soil<b> microbes </b>(Q34), which store the carbon in the soil.","The invention of agriculture some 10,000 <b>years ago</b><b> disrupted </b>these ancient soil-building processes and led to the loss of <b>carbon from the soil</b>. When humans started<b> draining </b>the natural topsoil, and<b> ploughing </b>it up for planting, they exposed the buried carbon to oxygen. This created <b>carbon dioxide</b> and released it into the air. And in <b>some places</b>,<b> grazing </b>by domesticated animals has removed all vegetation, releasing carbon into the air. Tons of carbon have been<b> stripped </b>from the world’s soils – where it’s needed – and<b> pumped </b>into the atmosphere.","So what can be done? <b>Researchers are now</b> <b>coming up</b> with evidence that even modest changes to farming can significantly help to <b>reduce the amount</b> of carbon in the atmosphere.","Some growers have <b>already started</b> using an approach known as<b> regenerative </b>agriculture. This aims to boost the<b> fertility </b>of soil and keep it<b> moist </b>through established practices (Q35). These include keeping fields planted <b>all <b>year round</b></b>, and increasing the variety of plants being grown (Q36). Strategies like these can significantly increase the <b>amount of carbon</b> stored in the soil, so agricultural <b>researchers are now</b> building a case for their use in combating <b>climate change</b>.","One American investigation into the potential for storing CO2 on agricultural lands is <b>taking place</b> in California. <b>Soil scientist</b> Whendee Silver of the University of California, Berkeley, is conducting a first-of-its-kind study on a large cattle farm in the state (Q37). She and her students are testing the effects on carbon storage of the<b> compost </b>that is created from waste – both agricultural, including<b> manure </b>and cornstalks, and waste produced in gardens (Q38), such as leaves, branches, and<b> lawn </b>trimmings.","In Australia, soil<b> ecologist </b>Christine Jones is testing another promising soil-enrichment strategy. Jones and 12 farmers are <b>working to build</b> up soil carbon by<b> cultivating </b>grasses that stay green <b>all <b>year round</b></b> (Q39). Like composting, the <b>approach has</b> already been proved experimentally; Jones now hopes to show that it can be applied on working farms and that the resulting carbon capture can be accurately measured.","It’s hoped in the future that <b>projects such</b> as these will demonstrate the role that farmers and other <b>land managers</b> can play in reducing the <b>harmful effects</b> of <b>greenhouse gas</b>es. For example, in countries <b>like the United</b> States, where most farming operations use large applications of fertiliser, changing such long-standing habits will require a change of system. Rattan Lal argues that farmers should receive payment not just for the corn or beef they produce but also for the carbon they can store in their soil.

But we don’t have bikes here… is there somewhere we could rent them?","TC EMPLOYEE:   Yes, there’s a place <b>here in the city</b>. It’s called Ratchesons. (Q7)","VISITOR:              I’ll just <b>make a note</b> of that – er, how <b>do you spell</b> it?","TC EMPLOYEE:   R-A-T-C-H-E-S-O-N-S. It’s just be the<b> cruise </b>ship terminal.","VISITOR:              OK.","TC EMPLOYEE:   You’d <b>also need</b> to <b>pick up</b> a repair kit for the bike from there to take along with you, and you’d <b>need to take</b> along a snack and <b>some water</b> – it’d be best to get those in the city.","VISITOR:              Fine. That shouldn’t be a problem. And I assume I can rent a helmet from the bike place? (Q8)","TC EMPLOYEE:   Sure, you should definitely get that. It’s a great ride, but you want to be <b>well prepared</b> because it’s very remote – you won’t see <b>any shops</b> round there, or anywhere to stay (Q9), so you <b>need to get</b> <b>back in time</b> for the last boat.","VISITOR:              Yeah. So what sort of prices are we looking at here?","TC EMPLOYEE:   Let’s see, that’d be one adult and one <b>child for the cruise</b> with farm tour, that’s $117, and an adult and a <b>child for the cruise</b> only so that’s $214 dollars altogether. Oh, wait a minute, how old did you say your daughter was?","VISITOR:              Fifteen.","TC EMPLOYEE:   Then I’m afraid it’s $267 (Q10) <b>because she has</b> to pay the adult fare, which is $75 instead of the child fare which is $22 – sorry about that.","VISITOR:              That’s OK. Er, so how do …","#2 <b>Talk to <b>new <b>kitchen assistants</b></b></b> Transcript","The Part 2 <b>audio transcript</b> of <b>Talk to <b>new <b>kitchen assistants</b></b></b> in Cambridge 12 <b>Listening Test</b> 5 is as follows:","<b>Good <b>morning everyone</b></b>. My name’s <b>Joy Parkins</b> and I’m the restaurant manager. And I understand that none of you’ve <b>had any</b> <b>previous experience</b> as <b>kitchen assistants</b>? Well, you might be feeling a bit nervous now, but most of our <b>kitchen assistants</b> say they enjoy the work. OK, they might get shouted at sometimes, but it’s nothing personal, and they’re pleased that they have so many <b><b>different things</b> to do</b>, which means they never <b>get bored</b> (Q11). And I’ll tell you<b> straightaway </b>that if you do well, we might think about moving you up and giving you some more responsibility.","Right, well, you’ve all shown up on time, which is an<b> excellent </b>start. Now I’m <b>glad to see</b> none of you have<b> unsuitable </b>footwear, so that’s good – you need to be careful as the floors can <b>get very</b> wet and slippery. Those of you with <b>long hair</b> <b>have got</b> it well out of the way, but some of you’ll need to remove your rings and bracelets – <b>just put</b> them somewhere safe for today, and remember to leave them at home tomorrow, as they can be a safety hazard. (Q12)","Now it’s going to be a <b>busy day</b> for you all today – we don’t <b>have any</b> tables free for this evening, and <b>only a few</b> for lunch (Q13).<b> Fortunately </b>we’ve got our Head Chef back – he was away on holiday all <b>last week</b> which meant the other chefs had extra work. Now, I’ll <b>tell you a bit</b> more about the job in a minute but first, <b>some general</b> regulations.","For all of you, whatever your age, there’s some equipment you mustn’t use until you’ve been properly trained, like the waste disposal system for example, for <b><b>health and safety</b> reasons</b>. Then I think there are two of you here who are under 18 – that’s Emma and Jake, isn’t it? Right, so for you two, the meat slicer is out of<b> bounds </b>(Q14). And of course none of you are allowed to use the electric mixer until you’ve been shown how it works.","Now you may <b>have heard</b> that this can be a stressful job, and I <b>have to say</b> that can be true. You’ll be working an eight-hour day for the <b>first week</b>, though you’ll <b>have the chance</b> to <b>do overtime</b> after that as <b>well if you want</b> to. But however long the hours are, you’ll get a break in the middle.","What you will find is that you’re on your feet <b>all day</b> long, lifting and carrying, so if you’re not fit now you soon will be! You’ll find you don’t <b>have much</b> chance to <b>take it easy</b> – when someone tells you to <b><b>do some</b>thing</b> you <b>need to do</b> it<b> straightaway </b>(Q15&Q16) – but at least we do <b>have a very</b> efficient <b>air conditioning</b> system <b>compared with some</b> kitchens.","——————-","<b>Now <b>let <b>me <b>tell you about some</b></b></b></b> of the people you <b>need to know</b>. So as I said, I’m <b>Joy Parkins</b> and I decide who does what <b>during the day</b> and how long they work for (Q17). I’ll be <b>trying to get</b> you to work with as many <b>different people</b> in the kitchen as possible, so that you learn while you’re on the job.","<b>One person</b> whose name you must remember is David Field. If you injure yourself at all, even if it’s really minor, you must report to him and he’ll <b>make sure</b> the incident is recorded and you get the appropriate treatment (Q18).","He’s trained to give basic treatment to staff himself, or he’ll send you off somewhere else if necessary. Then there’s Dexter Wills – he’s the person you <b>need to see</b> if you<b> smash </b>a plate or <b>something like</b> that (Q19). Don’t <b>just leave</b> it and hope <b>no one</b> will notice – it’s really <b>important to get</b> things noted and replaced or there could be problems late.","And finally, there’s Mike Smith. He’s the <b>member of staff</b> who <b>takes care</b> of all the stores of perishables, so if you notice we’re getting low in flour or sugar or something, <b>make sure</b> you <b>let him</b> know so he can <b>put in an order</b>. (Q20)","OK, now the <b>next thing</b> …","#3 <b>Paper on <b>Public libraries</b></b> Transcript","The Part 3 <b>audio transcript</b> of <b>Paper on <b>Public libraries</b></b> in Cambridge 12 <b>Listening Test</b> 5 is as follows:","TRUDIE:               OK, Stewart. We need to <b>start planning</b> our <b>paper on <b>public libraries</b></b>. Have you thought of an angle yet?","STEWART:           Well, there’s so much we could look into. How libraries <b>have <b>changed over the centuries</b></b>, for instance, or how <b>different countries</b> organise them. What <b>do you think</b>, Trudie?","TRUDIE:               Maybe we should<b> concentrate </b>on this country, and try relate the changes in libraries to<b> external </b>developments, <b>like the fact</b> that <b>far more people</b> can read than a century ago, and that the <b>local population</b> may speak <b>lots of different</b> languages. (Q21)","STEWART:           We could <b>include something</b> about changes in the source of funding, too.","TRUDIE:               Yes, but remember we’re only supposed to write a short paper, so it’s probably best if we don’t go into funding in any detail.","STEWART:           Right. Well, shall we just brainstorm a <b>few ideas</b>, to <b>get started</b>?","TRUDIE:               OK. We obviously <b>need to look</b> at the impact of <b>new technology</b>, particularly the internet. Now that lots of books have been digitalised, people can access them from their own computers at home.","STEWART:           And if everyone did that, libraries would be obsolete.","TRUDIE:               Yes.","STEWART:           But the<b> digitalised </b>books that are <b>available online</b> for free are mostly out of copyright, aren’t they? And copyright in this country lasts for 70 years after the author dies. So you won’t find the latest best-seller or up-to-date information. (Q22)","TRUDIE:               That’s an <b>important point</b>. Anyway, I find it hard to<b> concentrate </b>when I’m reading a long text on a green. I’d much rather read a physical book. And it takes longer to read on a screen.","STEWART:           Oh, I prefer it. I suppose it’s just a personal preference.","TRUDIE:               Mm. I expect that libraries will go on evolving in the <b>next <b>few years</b></b>. Some <b>have already</b> become centres where community activities <b>take place</b>, like local clubs meeting there. I think that’ll become even more common.","STEWART:           I’d like to think so, and that they’ll still be serving their traditional function, but I’m not so sure. There are financial implications, after all. What I’m afraid will happen is that books and magazines will all disappear, and there’ll just be rows and rows of computers (Q23). They won’t look <b>anything like</b> the libraries we’re used to.","TRUDIE:               Well, we’ll see.","———————–","TRUDIE:               I’ve <b>just had</b> an idea. Why don’t we make an in-depth study of our local <b>public library</b> as background to our paper?","STEWART:           Yes, that’d be interesting, and raise <b>all sorts</b> of issues. Let’s <b>make a list</b> of possible things we could ask about, then work out <b>some sort</b> of structure. For instance, um, we could interview some of the staff, and find out whether the library <b>has its own</b> budget, or if that’s controlled by the <b>local council</b>. (Q24)","TRUDIE:               And what their policies are. I know they don’t allow food, but I’d love to find out what <b>types of noise</b> they ban – there always seems to be a lot of talking, but never music. I don’t know if that’s a policy or it just happens.","STEWART:           Ah, I’ve <b>often wondered</b>. Then there are <b>things like</b> how the library is affected by employment laws. I suppose there are rules about working hours,<b> facilities </b>for staff, and so on. (Q25)","TRUDIE:               Right. Then there are <b>other issues</b> relating to the <b>design of the building</b> and how customers use it. Like what measures does the library take to ensure their safety? (Q26) They’d need <b>floor coverings</b> that aren’t slippery, and<b> emergency </b>exits, for instance. Oh, and <b>another thing</b> – there’s the question of the kind of insurance the library <b>needs to have</b>, in case anyone gets injured. (Q27)","STEWART:           Yes, that’s something else to find out. You <b>know something</b> I’ve <b>often wondered</b>?","TRUDIE:               What’s that?","STEWART:           Well, you know they’ve got an archive of <b>local newspapers</b> <b>going back</b> years? Well, next to it they’ve got the diary of a well-known<b> politician </b>from the late 19th century (Q28). I wonder why it’s there. <b>Do you know</b> what his connection was with this area?","TRUDIE:               <b>No idea</b>. Let’s add it to our list of things to find out. Oh, I’ve just thought – you know people might ask in the library about local organisations, like <b>sports clubs</b>? Well, I wonder if they keep a database, or whether they <b>just look</b> online. (Q29)","STEWART:           Right. I quite fancy finding out what the differences are between a library that’s <b>open to the public</b> and one that’s part of a museum, for example (Q30) – they must be <b>very different</b>.","TRUDIE:               Mmm. Then something else I’d <b>like to know</b> is …","#4 <b>Four <b>business values</b></b> Transcript","The Part 4 <b>audio script</b> of <b>Four <b>business values</b></b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 5 is as follows:","In public discussion of business, we take certain values for granted. Today I’m <b>going to talk</b> about four of them: collaboration, <b>hard work</b>, creativity and excellence. <b>Most people</b> would say they’re all ‘<b><b>good thing</b>s</b>’. I’m going to suggest that’s an over-simple view.","The trouble with these values is that they’re<b> theoretical </b>concepts, removed from the reality of day-to-day business. Pursue values by all means, but be prepared for what may happen as a result. They can actually cause damage, which is not at all the intention. (Q31)","<b>Business leaders</b> generally <b>try to do</b> the <b>right thing</b>. But <b>all too</b> often the <b>right thing</b> backfires, if those leaders adopt values without understanding and managing the <b>side effects</b> that arise (Q32). The values can easily <b>get in the way</b> of what’s actually intended.","OK. So the first value I’m <b>going to discuss</b> is collaboration. Er, <b>let <b>me give</b></b> you an example. On a management <b>training course</b> I once attended, we were put into groups and had to construct a bridge across a stream (Q33), using <b><b>building block</b>s</b> that we were given. The rule was that <b>everyone in the team</b> had to move at <b>least one</b> <b>building block</b> during the construction. This was intended to encourage teamwork.","But it was really a job best done by <b>one person</b>. The other teams tried to collaborate on building the structure, and descended into confusion (Q34), with everyone getting in <b>each other</b>’s way. Our <b>team leader</b> solved the challenge brilliantly. She simply asked <b>everyone in the team</b> to move a piece a <b>few centimetres</b>, to comply with the rule, and then let the person in the team with an aptitude for puzzles like this build it alone. We finished before <b>any other</b> team. My point is that the task wasn’t really suited to teamworking, so why make it one?","Teamwork can <b>also lead</b> to<b> inconsistency </b>– a common cause of poor sales. In the case of a smartphone that a certain company launched, <b>one director</b> wanted to target the business market, and another demanded it was aimed at consumers. The company wanted both directors to be involved, so gave the product a consumer-friendly name, but marketed it to companies. The result was that it met the needs of neither group. It would <b>have been better</b> to let <b>one director</b> or the other have his way, not both. (Q35)","Now industriousness, or <b>hard work</b>. It’s easy to mock people who say they work hard: after all, a hamster running around in a wheel is working hard – and getting nowhere. Of course <b>hard work</b> is valuable, but only when properly targeted. Otherwise it wastes the resources that companies value most – <b>time and energy</b>. And that’s bad for the organisation. (Q36)","There’s a management model that groups people according to four criteria: clever, hard-working, stupid and lazy. Here ‘lazy’ means having a<b> rational </b>determination not to carry out unnecessary tasks (Q37). It doesn’t mean <b>trying to avoid</b> <b>work altogether</b>. <b>Most people</b> display two of these characteristics, and the <b>most valuable</b> people are those who are both clever and lazy: they possess intellectual clarity, and they don’t rush into making decisions.","They <b>come up</b> with solutions to save the <b>time and energy</b> spent by the stupid and hard-working group. Instead of throwing more man-hours at a problem, the clever and lazy group looks for a more effective solution.","Next we come to creativity. This often <b>works well</b> – creating an attention-grabbing TV commercial, for example, might lead to increased sales. But it isn’t always a <b>good thing</b>. Some advertising campaigns are remembered for their creativity, without <b>having any</b> effect on sales. This happened a <b><b>few years</b> ago</b> with the launch of a chocolate bar: subsequent research showed that plenty of consumers remembered the adverts, but <b>had <b>no idea</b></b> what was being advertised (Q38). The trouble is that the creator derives pleasure from <b>coming up</b> with the idea, and wrongly assumes the audience for the campaign will share that feeling.","<b>A </b> company that brings out thousands of <b>new products</b> may seem more creative than a company that only has a few, but it may be too creative, and make smaller profits. Creativity needs to be targeted, to solve a problem that the company <b>has identified</b> (Q39). Just <b>coming up</b> with more and more novel products isn’t necessarily a <b>good thing</b>.","And finally, excellence. We <b>all know</b> companies that claim they ‘strive for excellence’, but it takes a <b>long time</b> to achieve excellence. In business, being first with a product is more profitable than having the best product. A major study of company performance compared pioneers – that is, companies bringing out the first version of a particular product – with followers, the companies that copied and improved on that product. The <b>study found</b> that the pioneers commanded an average <b>market share</b> of 29 percent, while the followers achieved less than half that, only 13 percent (Q40) – <b>even though</b> their product might <b>have been better</b>.","Insisting on<b> excellence </b>in <b>everything we do</b> is time-consuming, wastes energy and leads to losing out on opportunities. Sometimes, second-rate work is more worthwhile than excellence. ‘<b>Make sure</b> it’s excellent’ <b>sounds like</b> a good approach to business, but the ‘just-get-started’ approach is likely to be more successful."]},{"name":"ALS/12-2","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Events during Kenton Festival Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of <b>Events <b>during <b>Kenton Festival</b></b></b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 6 is as follows:","MAN:                    <b>Good morning</b>, Kenton <b><b>Festival box</b> office</b>.

I’ve now almost succeeded in finalising plans for our tour, so I’ll <b><b>bring you up</b> to date</b> with what I know.","As you know, we’re flying first to Munich, on Monday the 4th.","The flight is at 11.30, so it’s <b>too early</b> to <b>have lunch</b> at the airport. I suggest we meet there for coffee at 10 (Q11), which should give us <b>plenty of time</b> for breakfast before we leave home.","When we arrive in Munich, we’ll be met at the airport by Claus Bauer. Claus works for a tour operator (Q12), and he’ll look after us for the time we’ll be in Germany. He’s already<b> liaised </b>with the managers of the theatres we’re going to visit, and he’s also arranged for an officer of the National Theatre in Munich to show us round the theatre one afternoon during our stay.","Now <b>last time</b> we discussed this trip, I didn’t have the precise cost for <b>hotel room</b>s, but now I have. The normal rate at the hotel where we’re staying is 150<b> euros </b>a night for a double room. I’d hoped to get that down to 120 euros, but in fact I’ve been able to negotiate a rate of 110 (Q13). That’ll be reflected in the final payment which you’ll <b>need to make</b> by the end of this week.","On Tuesday, the day after our arrival, I had hoped we could sit in on a<b> rehearsal </b>at one of the theatres, but unfortunately that’s proved <b>very difficult</b> to arrange, so instead we’ll have a <b>coach trip</b> to one of the amazing<b> castles </b>in the mountains south of Munich.","On Tuesday evening, we’ll <b>all have</b> dinner together in a restaurant near our hotel. From talking to you all about your preferences, it was clear that a typical local restaurant would be too meat-oriented for some of you. Some of you suggested an Italian restaurant, but I must confess that I decided to book a Lebanese one (Q14), as we have <b>plenty of opportunities</b> to go to an Italian restaurant at home.","On Wednesday afternoon, the director of the play we’re <b>going to see</b> that evening will talk to us at the theatre (Q15). She’ll describe the <b>whole process</b> of producing a play, including how she chose the actors, and, as the play we’re <b>going to see</b> is a modern one, how she worked with the playwright.","——————","Right. Now I’d just <b>like to make</b> a few points about the plays we’re <b>going to see</b>, <b>partly because</b> it might influence your choice of clothes to take with you!","The play we’re seeing on Wednesday evening is a modern one, and we’re going to the<b> premiere </b>(Q16), so it’ll be quite a<b> dressy </b>occasion, <b>though of course</b> you don’t have to <b>dress formally</b>. I gather it’s rather a multimedia production, with amazing lighting effects and a<b> soundtrack </b>of<b> electronic </b>music, though unfortunately the<b> playwright </b>is ill and is unlikely to be <b>able to attend</b>.","On Thursday we’re seeing a play that was first performed <b>last year</b>, when it was<b> commissioned </b>to mark a <b>hundred years</b> since the birth in the town of a well-known scientist (Q17). We’re <b>going to see</b> a<b> revival </b>of that production, which<b> aroused </b>a lot of interest.","Friday’s play will really make you think hard about what clothes to pack, as it’ll be in the garden of a palace (Q18). It’s a beautiful setting, but I’d better warn you, there won’t be much protection from the wind.","On Saturday, we’re going by coach to a theatre in another town, not far from Munich. This will be the opening of a drama festival, and the mayor and <b>all the other</b><b> dignitaries </b>of the town will be attending (Q19). After the performance, the mayor is hosting a reception for all the audience, and there’ll be a band playing traditional music of the region.","And after having a day off on Sunday, our final play is on Monday, and it’s in the<b> stunning </b>setting of the old <b>Town Hall</b>, which <b>dates back</b> to the 14th century (Q20). The performance marks the <b>fifty years</b> that the lead actor has been on stage, and the play is the one where he made his first professional appearance, <b>all those years</b> ago.","And the day after that, we’ll be flying <b>back home</b>.

I’m Beth Cartwright – please call be Beth.","JAMES:                 Thank you.","BETH:                   Now as this is your first tutorial since you started on the <b>Scandinavian Studies</b> course, I’d like to <b>find out something</b> about you. Why did you decide to take this course?","JAMES:                 Well, my mother is Danish, and although we always lived in England, she used to talk about her home a lot, and that <b>made me</b> want to visit Denmark. We <b>hardly ever</b> did, though – my mother usually went on her own. But whenever her relations or friends were in England they always <b>came to see</b> us. (Q21)","BETH:                   I see. So I assume you already speak Danish, one of the languages you’ll be studying.","JAMES:                 I can get by when I talk to people, though I’m not<b> terribly </b>accurate.","BETH:                   Now you probably know that you’ll spend the <b>third year</b> of the course abroad. <b><b>Have you had</b> any</b> thoughts about that?","JAMES:                 I’m really <b>looking forward</b> to it. And although Denmark seems the obvious place to go, because of my family connections, I’d love to spend the time in Iceland.","BETH:                   Oh, I’m sure it can be arranged. <b><b>Do you have</b> any</b> plans for when you graduate? A lot of students go on to take a master’s degree.","JAMES:                 I think the <b>four years</b> of the undergraduate course will be enough for me. I’m interested in journalism, and I quite <b>like the idea</b> of moving to Scandinavia and writing for magazines (Q22). I’d find that more creative than translating, which I suppose most graduates do.","BETH:                   OK. Now how are you finding the courses you’re taking this term, James?","JAMES:                 Well, I’m really enjoying the one on Swedish cinema.","BETH:                   That’ll continue next term, but the one on Scandinavian literature that’s running at the moment will be replaced by more specialised courses (Q23). Oh, and by the way, if you’re interested in watching Danish television programmes – there’s going to be a course on that the term after next.","JAMES:                 That <b>sounds good</b>.","BETH:                   Have you started thinking about the literature paper that you <b>have to write</b> in the next <b>few weeks</b>?","JAMES:                 Yes, my <b>first choice</b> would be to <b><b>do some</b>thing</b> on the Icelandic sagas.","BETH:                   Hmm. The trouble with that is that a <b>lot of people</b> choose that topic, and it can be <b>difficult to get</b> hold of the books you’ll need. Why not leave that for <b>another time</b>?","JAMES:                 Right.","BETH:                   You might find modern novels or 19th century<b> playwrights </b>interesting. (Q24)","JAMES:                 I’ve read or seen several plays in translation, so that would be a <b>good idea</b>.","BETH:                   Fine. I’ll put you down for that topic.","JAMES:                 Right. So what would you advise me to aim at in the paper?","BETH:                   First I suggest you <b>avoid taking</b> one writer and going into a <b>great deal</b> of detail. That approach certainly has its place, but I think you first <b>need to get</b> an understanding of the literature in the context of the society in which it was produced – who it was written for, how it was published, and so on (Q25). I also think that’s more fruitful than placing it within the history of the genre.","JAMES:                 OK, that sounds reasonable.","————————","JAMES:                 Could I ask for <b>some advice</b> about writing the paper I’m working on about the Vikings? I <b>have to do</b> that this week, and I’m a bit stuck.","BETH:                   Of course. <b>Have you decided</b> yet what to write about?","JAMES:                 No, I haven’t. There’s so much that seems interesting – Viking settlement in <b>other countries</b>, trade,<b> mythology </b>…","BETH:                   Well, what I suggest is that you read an assignment a student wrote <b>last year</b> (Q26), which is kept in the library. It’s short and well focused, and I’m sure you’ll find it helpful. I’ll <b>give you the details</b> in a moment. Textbooks usually cover so many topics, it can be <b>very difficult</b> to choose <b>just one</b>.","JAMES:                 OK. I’ve got a DVD of the film about the Vikings that came out earlier this year. Should I watch that again?","BETH:                   If it’s the one I am thinking of, hmm, I’d ignore it – it’s more fantasy than reality. But I’ve got a recording of a documentary that you should watch (Q27). It makes <b>some interesting</b> and<b> provocative </b>points, which I think will help you to focus your topic.","JAMES:                 Right.","BETH:                   So then should I work out an outline? (Q28)","JAMES:                 Yes. Just headings for different sections, at this stage. And then you should start <b>looking for suitable</b> articles and books to draw on, and <b><b>take no</b>tes</b> (Q29) which you organise according to those headings.","BETH:                   I see.","JAMES:                 Then put short phrases and sentences as bullet points under each heading (Q30). <b>Make sure</b> that this skeleton <b>makes sense</b> and flows properly, before writing up the paper in full.","BETH:                   OK. Thanks, that’s <b>very helpful</b>.","#4 <b>Conflict at work</b> Transcript","The Part 4 <b>audio script</b> of <b>Conflict at work</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 6 is as follows:","Over the years, attitudes towards workers <b>have changed</b> considerably. After all, there was a time when workers <b>had no</b> rights at all, and<b> laboured </b>in<b> appalling </b>conditions. Conditions have <b>improved a lot</b>, but <b>conflict in the workplace</b> is still common. And <b>human resources</b> managers nowadays <b>need to be able</b> to deal with it when necessary.","What is <b>conflict in the workplace</b>? Definitions vary, but I’m taking it to refer to a <b>whole range</b> of behaviours that the victim finds unacceptable, from minor, harmless arguments to – at the<b> opposite </b>extreme – physical violence. Much of this is covered by the term bullying (Q31), by which I mean one or more people behaving<b> abusively </b>or aggressively against another who is in a weaker position. <b>Although all</b> behaviour like this is a form of conflict, not all conflict can be described in these terms.","As with <b>all human</b> behaviour, there are<b> numerous </b>reasons for it. But often it’s caused by someone who feels the need to show their<b> superiority </b>over someone else (Q32), in order to feel that they aren’t at the lowest level in a hierarchy or a <b>group of people</b>.","In <b>some cases</b> <b>one person</b> simply dislikes the other, on the basis that the personality of one is in <b>some way</b><b> incompatible </b>with that of the other person (Q33). A general habit of<b> optimism </b>in <b>one person</b> could make them<b> intolerant </b>of a colleague who’s constantly<b> pessimistic </b>– not that that justifies treating them badly, of course.","Some conflicts arise when people are more interested in promoting themselves and their team than in the <b>company as a whole</b>. These conflicts are called ‘structural’ (Q34), and could come about, for example, when a sales team believe they are the <b>only people</b> in the business who <b>do any</b> useful work, and <b>look down</b> on behind-the-scenes administrators.","Conflict obviously affects the individuals concerned – the situation is likely to be very stressful for victims, resulting in their absence from work, possibly for months (Q35). For the company, if no effort is made to deal with conflict, it can<b> spiral </b>out of control, and <b>even lead</b> to the breakdown of the business.","<b>Some interesting</b> work with <b><b>chief executive</b>s</b> – CEOs – has uncovered some of the reasons why they may treat colleagues badly. Many CEOs combine two<b> opposing </b>characteristics: confidence – that is, the belief that they’re capable of great achievements – with a <b>high level</b> of anxiety (Q36), a fear of missing targets, whether set by themselves or by the directors of the company. This combination can make them respond badly to anyone who questions their decisions.","In a high pressure <b>work environment</b>, such characteristics become problematic. And it’s particularly difficult to<b> tackle </b>the situation where colleagues, managers and <b>board members</b> are all trying to achieve their own visions. When they can’t agree on strategic issues and on where they see the business going, there are real problems. (Q37)","For managers at lower levels within the organisation, it might seem that an<b> autocratic </b>form of management – where the <b>chief executive</b> gives orders and everyone else has to obey – would see more conflict than others. Interestingly, though, a company with a more<b> democratic </b>business model, can suffer more, when uncertainly about who to report to leads to conflicting demands. (Q38)","Now I’ll <b>say a little</b> about dealing with the type of conflict that has <b>harmful effects</b>. Of course the ideal is to prevent it arising in the <b>first place</b>. A good manager, at any level, will make efforts to earn the respect of the people they work with (Q39), particularly those who report to them. That will involve<b> politeness </b>in all communications, and treating them as equals who <b>happen to have</b> a <b>different role</b> within the organisation.","Sometimes, of course, conflict does occur, and can <b>get out of hand</b>. In such cases the <b>human <b>resources department</b></b> often <b>gets involved</b>. However, if one of the parties in a conflict sees <b>human resources</b> as simply a<b> mouthpiece </b>for the <b>chief executive</b>, then an<b> external </b>mediator might be <b>able to help</b> (Q40). By talking to both sides, and trying to find the truth of what’s been happening, they can build a <b>clear picture</b> of the situation, and give feedback that both sides will accept, <b>precisely because</b> they’re independent."]},{"name":"ALS/12-3","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Public library Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of <b>Public library</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 7 is as follows:","SUSIE:   Hello?","PAUL:    Hi, Susie, it’s Paul here. How are you? Enjoying your <b>new job</b>? You’re working at the library, aren’t you?","SUSIE:   Yes. I started when the library re-opened a month ago (Example). It’s great.","PAUL:    Actually Carol and I have been meaning to join for a while.","SUSIE:   Oh, you should. It doesn’t cost anything, and the new <b>library has</b> <b>all sorts</b> of facilities. It’s not just a place where you borrow books. For instance, there’s an area with comfortable seats where you can sit and read the magazines they have there. Some <b>people spend</b> the whole morning there.","PAUL:    Mmm. Wish I had that <b>amount of time</b> to spend!","SUSIE:   Yes, you must be pretty busy at present, with the children and everything?","PAUL:    We are, yes. But we’re <b>hoping to get</b> away this summer. We’re thinking of going to Greece.","SUSIE:   Well, we’ve got a <b>much larger</b> section of the library<b> devoted </b>to travel books now (Q1), so you should come and <b>have a look</b>. I can’t remember if there’s anything specifically on Greece, but I should think so.","PAUL:    OK. Now Carol’s organising a project for the history class she teaches at school – it’s about life in the town a <b><b>hundred years</b> ago</b>. <b><b>Do you have</b> any</b>thing that might be useful?","SUSIE:   Yes, actually we’ve <b>now got</b> a new section with materials on the <b>history of the town</b> and surrounding region. (Q2)","PAUL:    Right. I’ll tell her. You can’t always find that <b>sort of thing</b> on the internet. Now in the old library there used to be a separate room with<b> reference </b>books. It was a <b>really nice</b> quiet room.","SUSIE:   Yes. We’ve put those books in the <b>main part</b> of the library now, but we <b>do have</b> a room called the community room. It can be hired out for meetings, but at <b>other times</b> people can use it to study. (Q3)","PAUL:    I might use that. It’s hard to find anywhere quiet at ho<b>me some</b>times.","SUSIE:   I can’t remember how old your son and daughter are … we’ve introduced a special section of fiction written<b> specially </b>for teenagers (Q4), but they might be a bit young for that?","PAUL:    Yes, they would be.","—————-","SUSIE:   Well, we <b>do have</b> lots of activities for younger children.","PAUL:    Yes?","SUSIE:   For example we have a Science Club. At the next meeting, they’re going to be doing experiments with stuff that <b>every<b>one has</b></b> in the kitchen (Q5) – <b>sugar and flour</b> and so on.","PAUL:    They might be interested, yes.","SUSIE:   And we <b>have a competition</b> for children called Reading Challenge. That doesn’t begin until after the end of term. They have to read six books, and they get a certificate if they manage it.","PAUL:    So that gives them <b>something to do</b> while they’re on holiday, instead of <b>getting bored</b>.","SUSIE:   That’s the idea. And there are special activities for adults too. On Friday we <b>have a local</b> author called Tanya Streep who’s going to be talking about her new novel. It’s called ‘Catch the Mouse’ and she based the story on a crime that actually took <b>place here</b> <b>years ago</b>. (Q6)","PAUL:    Right. We’re not free on Friday, but I’ll took out for the book.","SUSIE:   Now this probably isn’t for you, but we <b>do have</b> IT support available for members. We get <b>quite a few</b> older <b>people coming</b> along who are wanting to <b>get up</b> to speed with computer technology. It’s on Tuesday mornings – they don’t need to <b>make an appointment</b> or anything, they <b><b>just turn</b> up</b>. (Q7)","PAUL:    Well, my mother might be interested, I’ll let her know.","SUSIE:   OK. And there’s another service which you wouldn’t expect from a library, which is a free medical check-up. The hospital arranges for someone to come along and measure the level of sugar in your blood, and they check<b> cholesterol </b>levels at the <b>same time</b>. (Q8)","PAUL:    Really?","SUSIE:   Yes, but that’s only for the over-60s, so you wouldn’t qualify.","PAUL:    OK. Well, I’ll tell my mother, she might be interested.","SUSIE:   What <b>other information</b> … well, we <b>do have</b> a little<b> shop </b>with <b>things like</b><b> wallcharts </b>and greetings cards, and also stamps (Q9) so you can post the cards straightaway, which is <b>really useful</b>.","PAUL:    Yeah. Well, I’ll bring the children round at the weekend and we’ll join. Oh, <b>one more thing</b> – I’ll be bringing the car, is there parking available? (Q10)","SUSIE:   Yes, and it’s free in the evening and at weekends.","PAUL:    Perfect.

Now, the travel business is <b>very competitive</b> and it’s important to be aware of how the market’s changing and developing. In terms of <b>age groups</b>, the over-65s are an important market, and one that’s increasing steadily year on year (Q11&Q12).","The fewest holidays are taken by the 31 to 42-year-olds, and that figure <b>shows no</b> sign of rising. The biggest market at present is still the youngest group, the 16 to 30s, but this group’s <b>also see</b>n the biggest drop over the last <b>few years</b>, whereas there’s a noticeable growth in the number of <b>holidays take</b>n by the 55 to 64-year-olds (Q11&12). As far as the 43 to 54-year-olds are concerned, bookings there are steady, but I <b>have to say</b> we haven’t seen the increase we expected.","<b>One trend</b> we’re noticing with <b>nearly all</b> <b>age groups</b> is the <b>growing popularity</b> of holidays in which clients do <b>some kind</b> of specialised activity. I’m not talking here about adventure holidays, where clients <b>take part</b> in high-risk activities like white water<b> rafting </b>just for the thrill of it. <b>Activity holidays</b> usually involve <b>rather less</b> high-risk sports, or <b>things like</b> art and music.","They’re not necessarily cheaper than ordinary holidays, often the opposite, in fact. But they do often <b>take place</b> outside the main tourist centres, which gives an opportunity for clients to find out more about the <b>local people</b> and customs (Q13&Q14), and many say this is <b>one of the most</b> positive features of these holidays.","Of course, they offer the chance to develop a new skill or talent, but clients often say that more than this, it’s the chance to create lasting <b>relationships with other</b> like-minded people that’s the main draw. (Q13&Q14)","<b>Let <b>me <b>give you some</b></b></b> examples of <b>BC Travel</b> <b>activity holidays</b>. Our painting <b><b>holidays take</b> place</b> in <b>four different</b> centres in France and Italy and they’re <b>very popular</b> with clients of all abilities from beginners onwards. We’ve got an<b> excellent </b>team of artists to lead the classes – <b>some of them have</b> been with us from the start, and five additional ones will be joining us this year (Q15) so that we can offer a <b>greater number</b> of classes in each centre.","As far as cooking classes on holidays are concerned, I <b>know a lot</b> of agents offer holidays where clients cook recipes related to <b><b>one part</b>icular</b> country, usually the one they’re staying in, but we focus on dishes from a <b>great many</b> <b>different ones</b> (Q16). Apart from that, you’ll find the usual<b> emphasis </b>on <b>good quality</b>, organic ingredients – that’s more or less a given nowadays – and there are generally some meat-free recipes included.","Our<b> photography </b><b><b>holidays take</b> place</b> in a <b>wide range</b> of countries from Iceland to Vietnam, and clients <b>have the opportunity</b> to <b>see some</b> <b>stunning scenery</b>. Groups are small, no more than eight, so clients can <b>have one</b>-on-one tuition during the holiday (Q17), and<b> excursions </b>are arranged with fully-trained guides. At the <b>end of each</b> holiday an exhibition is held of the<b> photographs </b>taken so that clients can see <b>one another</b>’s work and receive valuable feedback from the tutor.","——————–","Finally, <b>let <b>me tell</b></b> you about our <b>fitness holidays</b>. In Ireland and Italy we run one-week general fitness classes for <b>all ages</b> and levels of fitness. Clients start the course with a consultation with a trainer, and together they <b>draw up</b> an individual programme. As <b>well as improving</b> general fitness, clients find that they <b>end up</b> losing much of the stress they’ve <b>built up</b> in their daily lives. (Q18)","In Greece, we have a two-week holiday for clients who <b>want to <b><b>do some</b>thing</b></b> about their weight (Q19). This has <b>all the features</b> you’d expect, like a<b> personalised </b>diet programme, but one of its <b>most popular</b> features is that the exercise classes are all held on the beach. <b>People say</b> it’s far preferable to being in a gym.","Finally, we offer several holidays in Morocco. <b><b>One <b>very popular</b></b> one</b> is the mountain biking holiday. Bikes are provided and there are <b><b>different routes</b> according</b> to people’s ability. We offer one which is tailored to the needs of families (Q20), which is particularly popular.","OK, so that’s about <b>all the time</b> I have today, so <b><b>thank you very</b> much</b> …","#3 The <b><b>Horton Castle</b> site</b> Transcript","The Part 3 <b>audio transcript</b> of The <b><b>Horton Castle</b> site</b> in Cambridge 12 <b>Listening Test</b> 7 is as follows:","NATALIE:             Dave, I’m worried about our <b>case study</b>. I’ve done a bit of reading, but I’m not sure what’s involved in actually writing a <b>case study</b> – I missed the lecture where <b>Dr Baker</b> talked us through it.","DAVE:                   OK, well it’s <b>quite straightforward</b>. We’ve got our focus – that’s tourism at the <b><b>Horton Castle</b> site</b>. And you said you’d <b>done some</b> reading about it.","NATALIE:             Yes, I found some articles and made notes of the <b>main point</b>s.","DAVE:                   Did you remember to keep a record of where you got the information from? (Q21)","NATALIE:             Sure. I know what a pain it is when you forget that.","DAVE:                   OK, so we can compare what we’ve read. Then we <b>have to decide</b> on a particular <b>problem or need</b> at our site. And then think about who we’re <b>going to interview</b> to <b>get more information</b>.","NATALIE:             OK. So who’d that be? The people who work there (Q22)? And<b> presumable </b>some of the tourists too?","DAVE:                   Yes, both those groups. So we’ll <b>have to go</b> to the site to do that, I suppose. But we might <b>also do</b> some of our interviewing away from the site – we could even contact <b>some people</b> <b>here in the city</b>, like administrators involved in overseeing tourism. (Q23)","NATALIE:             OK. So we’ll <b>need to think</b> about our interview questions and fix times and places for the meetings. It’s all <b>going to take</b> a <b>lot of time</b>.","DAVE:                   Mmm. And if we can, we should ask our interviewees if they can bring along some<b> numerical </b>data that we can add to support our findings.","NATALIE:             And photographs?","DAVE:                   I <b>think we have</b> plenty of those already. But <b>Dr Baker</b> <b>also said</b> we have to establish with our interviewees whether we can identify them in our <b>case study</b>, or whether they want to be anonymous. (Q24)","NATALIE:             Oh, I wouldn’t <b>have thought</b> of that. OK, once we’ve <b>got all</b> this information, I suppose we <b>have to analyse</b> it.","DAVE:                   Yes, put it all together and choose what’s<b> relevant </b>to the problem we’re focusing on, and analyse that carefully to find out if we can <b>identify any</b> trends or regularities (Q25) there. That’s the <b>main thing</b> at this stage, rather can<b> concentrating </b>on details or lots of facts.","NATALIE:             OK. And then once we’ve analysed that, what next?","DAVE:                   Well, then we <b>need to think</b> about what we do with the data we’ve selected to make it as clear as possible to our readers. <b>Things like</b> graphs, or tables, or charts.","NATALIE:             Right.","DAVE:                   Then the <b>case study</b> itself is mostly quite standard; we begin by presenting the problem, and giving some background, then <b>go through the main</b> sections, but the thing that <b>surprised me</b> is that in a normal report we’d end with some suggestions to deal with the <b>problem or need</b> we identified, but in a <b>case study</b> we <b>end up</b> with a question or a series of questions to our readers, and they decide what ought to be done. (Q26)","NATALIE:             Oh, I hadn’t realised that.","————————–","NATALIE:             So basically, the problem we’re addressing in our <b>case study</b> of the <b><b>Horton Castle</b> site</b> is why so few tourists are visiting it. And we’ll find out more from our interviews, but I <b>did find</b> one report on the internet that <b>suggested that one</b> reason might be because as far as transport goes, access is difficult.","DAVE:                   I read that too, but that report was actually written <b>ten years</b> ago, when the road there was <b>really bad</b>, but that’s been improved now. And I think there’s plenty of fascinating stuff there for a <b>really good</b> day out, but you’d never realise it from the<b> castle </b>website – maybe that’s the problem. (Q27)","NATALIE:             Yes, it’s really dry and boring.","DAVE:                   I read somewhere a suggestion that what the<b> castle </b>needs is a <b>visitor centre</b>. So we could <b>have a look</b> for <b>some information</b> about that on the internet. What would we <b>need to know</b>?","NATALIE:             Well, who’d use it for a start. It’s be <b>good to know</b> what categories the visitors fell into too, like school parties or retired people, but I think we’d have to talk to staff to get that information.","DAVE:                   OK. And as we’re thinking of suggesting a <b>visitor centre</b> we’d also <b>have to look</b> at potential problems. I mean, obviously it wouldn’t be cheap to <b>set up</b>.","NATALIE:             No, but it could be a <b>really good</b> investment. And as it’s on a historical site it’d <b>need to get</b> special planning permission, I expect. That might be hard. (Q28)","DAVE:                   Right, especially as the only possible place for it would be at the entrance, and that’s right in front of the castle.","NATALIE:             Mmm.","DAVE:                   But it could be a <b>good thing</b> for the town of Horton. At present it’s a bit of a ghost town. Once they’ve <b>left school</b> and <b>got any</b> skills or qualifications, the <b>young people</b> all get out as fast as they can to get jobs in the city, and the <b>only people</b> left are children and those who’ve retired. (Q29)","NATALIE:             Right. Something else we could investigate would be the potential damage that tourists might cause to the <b>castle site</b>, I mean their <b>environmental impact</b>. At present the tourists can just wander round wherever they want, but if numbers increase, there might have to be some restrictions, like<b> sticking </b>to marked ways. And there’d need to be guides and<b> wardens </b>around to <b>make sure</b> these were enforced. (Q30)","DAVE:                   Yes, we could <b>look at that too</b>. OK, well …","#4 <b><b><b>Effects of environmental</b> change</b> on birds</b> Transcript","The Part 4 <b>audio script</b> of <b><b><b>Effects of environmental</b> change</b> on birds</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 7 is as follows:","OK, so we’ve been looking at how man-made changes in our environment can affect wildlife. Now I’ll discuss a <b>particular example</b>. Let’s <b>take a look</b> at mercury. Mercury’s one of the 120 or so elements that <b>make up</b> all matter, and it has the symbol Hg. It’s a shiny,<b> silvery </b>substance. You may <b>have seen</b> it in old-fashioned thermometers, but it’s not used much for domestic purposes <b>now because</b> it’s highly toxic.","But the problem is that the amount of<b> mercury </b>in the environment’s increasing. The <b>main reason</b> for this is the power <b>plants used</b> to <b>produce electricity</b>. The main <b>source of energy</b> that most of them use is still coal, and when it’s burned it releases<b> mercury </b>into the atmosphere.","Some of this gets deposited into lakes and rivers, and if it’s<b> ingested </b>by a fish it’s not excreted, it stays in the fish’s body and it enters the food chain. So it’s been known for <b>some time</b> that birds which eat fish may be affected, but what wasn’t known until quite recently is that those that eat insects can also be affected. (Q31)","So a woman called Claire Varian-Ramos is <b>doing <b>some research</b></b> on how this is affecting birds.","And rather than looking at how <b>many birds</b> are actually killed by<b> mercury </b>poisoning, she’s looking for more subtle sub-effects. These may be to do with the behaviour of the birds, or with the effect of<b> mercury </b>on the way their brain works, so whether it leads to problems with memory, for example (Q32). And she’s particularly focusing on the effects of<b> mercury </b>on bird song. Now, the process of <b>song learning</b> happens at a particular stage in the birds’ development, and what you may not know is that a young bird seems to acquire this skill by listening to the songs produced by its father (Q33), rather than by any <b>other bird</b>.","And Varian-Ramos <b>has already</b> found in her research that if young <b>male birds</b> are exposed to mercury, if they <b>eat food</b><b> contaminated </b>with mercury, then the songs they produce aren’t as complex as those produced by <b>other bird</b>s (Q34). So quite low-level<b> exposure </b>to<b> mercury </b>is <b>likely to have</b> an impact on <b>male birds</b> in a natural situation, because it can mean that they’re less attractive to fe<b>male birds</b>, and so it can affect their chances of reproduction. (Q35)","Now the way she’s carrying out this research is worth thinking about. She’s using a mixture of studies using birds kept in laboratories, and studies carried out outdoors in the wild. The lab-based <b>studies have</b> the advantage that you don’t <b>g<b>et al</b>l</b> the variables you would in a natural setting, so the<b> experimenter </b>has a <b>much <b>higher level</b></b> of control (Q36), and that means they can be more confident about their results in <b><b>some way</b>s</b>. And of course they don’t have to worry about going out and finding the birds in order to observe them.","So what are the implications here for humans? Well, <b>because many</b> birds are migratory, they may be transporting<b> mercury </b>far from<b> contaminated </b>sites. For example, it’s been found that ducks who’d been feeding at a<b> contaminated </b>site were later shot by hunters over a thousand kilometres away, and<b> presumably </b>eaten (Q37). But these <b>birds like</b>ly had<b> mercury </b>levels <b>high enough</b> to warrant concern for <b>human consumption</b>.","In addition, <b>going back</b> to <b>song learning</b> by birds, we saw that this may be affected by <b>mercury contamination</b>. Well, we also know that in humans,<b> mercury </b>causes developmental delays in the acquisition of language (Q38), and in fact this process is <b>very similar</b> in the brain regions it involves and even the genes that are involved. But <b>mercury contamination</b> has other important implication for humans as well. It’s <b>now known</b> that an<b> unborn </b>child can be affected if the food eaten by its mother contains <b><b>high level</b>s</b> of<b> mercury </b>(Q39), and these effects can be quite substantial.","In the end, it <b>comes down</b> to whether more value is placed on human economic wellbeing or environmental wellbeing. It’s true there are <b>new regulations</b> for mercury<b> emissions </b>from power plants, but these will need billions of dollars to implement, and increase costs for everyone (Q40). <b>Some argue</b> that’s <b>too much</b> to pay to protect wildlife. But as we’ve seen, the issues <b>go beyond</b> that, and I think it’s an issue we <b>need to consider</b> <b>very careful</b>ly."]},{"name":"ALS/12-4","paragraph":["<h2>#1 City Tour Leader Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of <b>City Tour</b> Leader: Applicant Enquiry in <b>Listening Test</b> 8 is as follows:","BOB:                     Hello, Pembroke Cycling Holidays, Bob speaking.","MARGARET:        <b>Oh hello</b>.

As its name suggests, there was originally a market here where farmers brought their sheep, but now it’s been<b> redeveloped </b>into a buzzing, vibrant area of the city, which is <b>also home</b> to one of the city’s fastest-growing communities. The nearby <b>university has</b> always meant the area’s popular with students, who come in to enjoy the lively nightlife, but now graduates embarking on careers in the worlds of fashion and design are buying up the new apartments <b>recently built</b> here to replace the small houses where the market workers used to live. (Q11)","The narrow old side streets are great places for finding original pictures,<b> jewellery </b>and<b> ceramics </b>(Q12) which won’t break the bank, as well as local produce like <b>fruit and vegetables</b>. There’s also lots of<b> pavement </b>cafes where you can have a coffee and watch tourists from <b>all over the world</b> go by. The oldest buildings in the area are on the main streets, including the city’s first department store, built in the 1880s, which is still open today.","The Sheepmarket is a centre for fashion, and there’s a policy of encouraging new <b>young designers</b>. The <b>Young Fashion</b> <b>competition is open</b> to local young <b>people who are passionate</b> about fashion. This year they’ve been asked to design an outfit based on ideas from the music and technology that’s part of their <b>everyday life</b> (Q13), using both natural and man-made fibres. The garments will be judged by a panel of experts and <b>fashion designer</b>s, and the winning entries will be modelled at a special<b> gala </b>evening.","Parking at the Sheepmarket is easy. There are plenty of pay and display <b>car <b>parking spaces</b></b> on the<b> roadsides </b>which are fine if you <b>just want</b> to stay for an <b>hour or two</b>, but if you <b>want to spend</b> the day there it’s better to park in <b>one of the four</b> underground <b><b>car park</b>s</b>. It’s not expensive and if you can present a receipt from one of the local stores, you’ll not be charged at all (Q14). After <b>six pm</b> many of the <b><b>car park</b>s</b> have a flat rate which varies but it is <b>usually very</b> reasonable.","————————-","The Sheepmarket is <b>one of the main</b> centres for art and history in the whole of the country. If you look at our map, you’ll see <b>some of the main</b> attractions there. <b>Most visitors</b> start from Crawley Road, at the bottom of the map. The Reynolds House is <b>one of the oldest</b> houses in the city, and is <b>open to the public</b>. It’s on the north side of Crawley Road, next to the foot<b>path that leads</b> to the <b>public gardens</b>. (Q15)","The area’s <b>particularly interesting</b> for its<b> unusual </b>sculptures. The Thumb’s is just what its name suggests, but it’s about 10 <b>metres high</b>. You’ll see it on <b>Hill Road</b>, <b>across the road</b> from the Bank. (Q16)","The Museum’s got a particularly <b>fine collection</b> of <b>New Zealand</b> landscapes. It’s on the <b>east side</b> of the Sheepmarket, on <b>City Road</b>. It’s on the <b>other <b>side of the road</b></b> from the <b>public gardens</b>, immediately facing the junction with <b>Hill Road</b>. (Q17)","The Contemporary <b>Art Gallery</b> is on a little road that leads off Station Square, not far from the <b>public gardens</b>.

It’s on <b>City Road</b>, near the junction with Crawley Road, on the <b>same <b>side of the road</b></b> as the <b>public gardens</b> (Q19). It’s open on weekdays from 9 to 5, and entry is free.","Finally, if you’re interested in purchasing <b>high quality</b> artwork, the place to go is Nucleus.

I could do with getting someone else’s opinion.","JOE:       Of course, Katie. What are you <b>going to talk</b> about?","KATIE:   It’s about <b>film adaptations</b> of Shakespeare’s plays. I’ve <b>got very</b> <b>interested in all</b> the <b>different approaches</b> that film directors take.","JOE:       Uhuh.","KATIE:   So I thought I’d start with Giannetti, who’s professor of film and literature, and in one of his books he <b>came up</b> with a<b> straightforward </b>classification of <b>film adaptations</b> based on how faithful they are to the original plays and novels. (Q21)","JOE:       Right.","KATIE:   I’ve already made <b>some notes</b> on that, so I <b>just need</b> to sort those out before the presentation. I thought that next I’d ask the class to <b>come up</b> with the worst examples of Shakespeare adaptations that they’ve seen, and to say why (Q22). That should be more fun than having their favourite versions.","JOE:       Yes, I can certainly think of a couple!","KATIE:   Right. Next I <b>want to talk</b> about Rachel Malchow. I <b>came across</b> something on the internet about her work on <b>film adaptations</b>, and I was thinking of <b>showing some</b> film<b> clips </b>to illustrate her ideas.","JOE:       Will you have <b>enough time</b>, though? Both to prepare and during the presentation? After all, I doubt if you’ll be <b>able to find</b> all the<b> clips </b>you want.","KATIE:   Hmm. Perhaps you’re right. OK, well, I’d better do <b>some slides</b> instead, saying how various films relate to what she says (Q23). That should encourage discussion.","JOE:       Mmm.","KATIE:   <b>Next I want</b> to <b>say something</b> about how plays may be chosen for adaptation because they’re concerned with issues of the time when the film is made. (Q24)","JOE:       You <b><b>mean things</b> like</b> patriotism, or the role of governments?","KATIE:   Exactly. It’s quite tricky, but I’ve got a <b>few ideas</b> I’d <b>like to discuss</b>.","———————–","KATIE:   And finally I <b>want to talk</b> about a few adaptations that I think illustrate a range of approaches, and <b>make some</b> comments on them. <b>Do you know</b> the Japanese film Ran?","JOE:       I haven’t seen it. It was based on Shakespeare’s King Lear, wasn’t it?","KATIE:   That’s right. It was a very loose adaptation, <b>using the same</b> situation and story, but moving it to 16th century Japan instead of 16th century Britain (Q25). So for example the king’s daughters become sons, because in Japanese culture at that time, women couldn’t succeed to the throne.","JOE:       OK. I hope you’re <b>going to talk</b> about the 1993 film of Much Ado About Nothing. I think that’s <b>one of the best</b> Shakespeare films. It really brings the play to life, doesn’t it?","KATIE:   Yes, I agree. And I think filming it in Italy, where the play is set, makes you see what life was like at the time of the play. (Q26)","JOE:       Absolutely. Right, what’s next?","KATIE:   Er, next, I thought Romeo & Juliet, the 1996 film, which moves the action into the <b>present day</b>. (Q27)","JOE:       Yes, it worked <b>really well</b>, I thought – changing the two<b> feuding </b>families in the original to two competing business empires, <b>even though</b> they’re speaking in the English of the original play.","KATIE:   You’d expect it would sound really bizarre, but I found I soon got used to it.","JOE:       <b>Me too</b>.","KATIE:   Then I thought I’d include a real Hollywood film, one that’s intended to<b> appeal </b>to a mass commercial audience.","JOE:       There must be <b>quite a number</b> of those.","KATIE:   Yes, but I’ve picked the 1996 film of Hamlet. It included every line of the text, but it’s more like a typical action hero movie (Q28) – there are loads of special effects, but no unifying<b> interpretation </b>of the play.","JOE:       All show and no substance.","KATIE:   Exactly. Then there’s Prospero’s Books, based on The Tempest. That was really innovative, from a<b> stylistic </b><b>point of view</b>. (Q29)","JOE:       Didn’t it include dance and singing and animation, as well as live actors?","KATIE:   Yes, it did. I <b>also <b>want to mention</b></b> Looking for Richard. Did you ever see it? (Q30)","JOE:       No, but I’ve read about it. It was a<b> blend </b>of a documentary with a few<b> scenes </b>from Richard III, wasn’t it?","KATIE:   That’s right. It’s more a way of looking into how people nowadays connect with the<b> playwright </b>– the play is <b>really just</b> the <b>starting point</b>. And that’ll be where I finish.","JOE:       Well, it <b>sounds as though</b> it’ll be <b>very interesting</b>.","#4 <b>Noise in cities</b> Transcript","The Part 4 <b>audio script</b> of <b>Noise in cities</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 8 is as follows:","This lecture will be about the science of acoustics, the study of sound, in relation to <b>urban environments</b> such as cities. As an acoustic engineer myself, I think this is an area where we’re likely to see great changes. In the past, researching urban<b> soundscapes </b>was simple. We measured levels of sound in decibels, so I used to take my sound meter and I measured the noise somewhere, and then I might ask a sample of people to say at what level the sound became annoying.","With data like this, acoustic engineers <b>have been able</b> to <b>build up</b> what we call noise maps, maps of the sound environment. But actually these aren’t a lot of use. What they do show is that the highest noise levels are generally on roads – well, that’s not really very surprising. But there’s <b>quite a lot</b> going on that these maps don’t show, because they can’t capture the complex <b>way that sound</b> varies over time.","So they ignore <b>important issues</b> such as the noise someone might hear from the open windows or gardens of their neighbours (Q31), and this sort of noise can be quite significant in summer. We don’t <b>have any</b> databases on this <b>sort of information</b>. As well as that, these records of sound levels <b>take no</b> account of the <b>fact that people</b> vary in their perceptions of noise – so <b>someone like</b> me with years of working in acoustics might be <b>very different</b> from you in that regard.","But anyway, <b>even though</b> these noise maps are fairly crude, they’ve been useful in providing information and raising awareness that noise matters, we <b>need to deal</b> with it and so it’s a political matter (Q32). And that’s important – we need rules and regulation because noise can cause <b>all sorts</b> of problems.","Those of you who are city-dwellers know that things go on 24 hours a day, so city-dwellers often suffer from interrupted sleep. It’s <b>also known</b> that noise can lead to a rise in levels of stress, due to <b>physical changes</b> in the body <b>affecting the composition</b> of the blood. And there are <b>other problems</b> as well, for instance if<b> schoolchildren </b>don’t have a quiet place to study, their work will suffer. (Q33)","Now, one problem with<b> decibel </b>measurement is that it doesn’t<b> differentiate </b>between <b>different types</b> of noise. <b>Some types</b> of sounds that <b>most people</b> would probably think of as nice and relaxing might well score quite highly in <b>decibel levels</b> – think of the sound made by a<b> fountain </b>in a town square, for example (Q34). That’s not necessarily something that we’d want to control or reduce. So maybe researchers should consider these sorts of sounds in <b>urban design</b>. This is going to be tricky because just measuring <b>decibel levels</b> isn’t going to help us here. Instead, <b>many researchers</b> are <b>using social</b> science techniques, studying people’s emotional response to sound by using questionnaires and so on. (Q35)","So what exactly <b>do <b>people want</b></b> to hear in an urban environment? <b>Some recent</b><b> interdisciplinary </b><b>research has</b> come out with results that at first sight seem<b> contradictory </b>– a city <b>needs to have</b> a sense of activity, so it needs to be lively, with <b>sounds like</b> the clack of <b>high heels</b> on a<b> pavement </b>or the hiss of a coffee machine, but these mustn’t be too intrusive, because at the <b>same time</b> we <b>need to be able</b> to relax. (Q36)","<b>One of the major</b> problems in achieving this will be getting <b><b>architects and town</b> planners</b> to use the research. Apart from studying the basics of acoustics, these people receive <b>very little</b> training in this area (Q37). But in fact they should be regarding sound as an opportunity to add to the experience of urban living, whereas at present they <b>tend to see</b> it as something to be avoided or reduced as far as possible, or something that’s just a job for engineers like the street<b> drainage </b>system.","What’s needed is for <b>noise in cities</b> to be regarded as an aesthetic quality, as <b>something that has</b> the qualities of an <b>art form</b>. If we acknowledge this, then we urgently <b>need to know</b> what governs it and how designers can work with it. We <b>need to develop</b> a complex <b>understanding of many</b> factors. What is the relationship between sound and culture? (Q38) What can we learn from<b> disciplines </b>such as<b> psychology </b>about the <b>way that sound</b> interacts with human development and<b> social </b>relationships, and the <b>way that sound</b> affects our thought and feelings? Can we learn anything from<b> physics </b>about the nature of sound itself? (Q39)","Today’s powerful technologies can <b>also help</b> us. To show us their ideas and help us to imagine the effect their buildings will have, <b><b>architects and town</b> planners</b> already use virtual reality – but these programs are silent (Q40). In the future such programs could use realistic sounds, meaning that<b> soundscapes </b>could be explored before being built. So hopefully, using the best technology we can lay our hands on, the city of the future will be a pleasure to the ears as well as the eyes."]},{"name":"ALS/13-1","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Cookery Classes Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of <b>Cookery Classes</b> <b><b>listening <b>answers in Listening</b></b> Test</b> 1 is as follows:","OFFICIAL:            Hello, <b>Tourist Information</b> Centre, Mike speaking, how can I help you?","WOMAN:             Oh, hi.

I’ll start by<b> summarising </b>these changes before we open the meeting to questions.","So, why do we <b>need to make</b> these changes to traffic systems in Granford? Well, we’re very aware that traffic is <b>becoming an increasing</b> problem. It’s been especially noticeable with the increase in heavy traffic while they’ve been building the new hospital. But it’s the overall rise in the volume of traffic of <b>all kinds</b> that’s concerning us (Q11). To date, there’s not been any increase in traffic accidents, but that’s not something we <b>want to see</b> happen, obviously.","We recently <b>carried out a survey</b> of <b>local residents</b>, and their responses were interesting. People were very concerned about the lack of visibility on some roads due to cars parked along the sides of the roads (Q12). We’d expected complaints about the congestion <b>near the school</b> when parents are dropping off their children or picking them up, but this wasn’t top of the list, and nor were noise and<b> fumes </b>from trucks and lorries, though they were mentioned by <b>some people</b>.","We think these new traffic regulations would make a lot of difference. But we <b>still have</b> a <b>long way</b> to go. We’ve <b>managed to keep</b> our proposals within budget, just, so they can be covered by the Council. But, of course, it’s <b>no good</b> introducing <b>new regulations</b> if we don’t have a <b>way of making</b> sure that everyone obeys them (Q13), and that’s an area we’re <b>still working</b> on with the help of<b> representatives </b>from the police force.","—————–","OK, so this slide shows a map of the <b>central area</b> of Granford, with the <b>High Street</b> in the middle and <b>School Road</b> on the right. Now, we <b>already have</b> a set of traffic lights in the <b>High Street</b> at the junction with Station Road, but we’re <b>planning to have</b> another set at the <b>other end</b>, at the <b>School Road</b> junction (Q14), to regulate the flow or traffic along the <b>High Street</b>.","We’re decided we definitely need a <b>pedestrian crossing</b>. We considered putting this on <b>School Road</b>, <b>just outside</b> the school, but in the <b>end we decided</b> that could lead to a lot of <b>traffic congestion</b> so we decided to locate it on the <b>High Street</b>, crossing the road in front of the supermarket (Q15). That’s a <b>very busy</b> area, so it should help things there.","We’re proposing some changes to parking. At present, parking isn’t allowed on the <b>High Street</b> outside the library, but we’re going to change that, and allow parking there (Q16), but not at the <b>other end</b> of the <b>High Street</b> near <b>School Road</b>.","There’ll be a new ‘No Parking’ sign on <b>School Road</b>, just by the entrance to the school (Q17),<b> forbidding </b>parking for 25 metres. This should improve visibility for drivers and pedestrians, especially on the <b>bend just</b> to the north of the school.","As far as disabled drivers are concerned, at present they have parking outside the supermarket, but<b> lorries </b><b>also use</b> those spaces, so we’ve <b>got two</b> new <b>disabled parking</b> spaces on the side <b>road up</b> towards the bank (Q18). It’s not ideal, but <b>probably better</b> than the present arrangement.","We also plan to widen the<b> pavement </b>on <b>School Road</b>. We think we can manage to get an extra half-metre on the <b>bend just</b> before you get to the school, on the <b>same <b>side of the road</b></b> (Q19).","Finally, we’ve introduced new restrictions on loading and unloading for the supermarket, so<b> lorries </b>will only be allowed to stop there before 8 am. That’s the supermarket on <b>School Road</b> (Q20) – we kept to the existing arrangements with the <b>High Street</b> supermarket.","OK. So that’s about it. Now, would anyone …","#3 <b>Jack <b>seed germination</b></b> Transcript","The Part 3 <b>audio transcript</b> of <b>Jack <b>seed germination</b></b> in Cambridge 13 <b>Listening Test</b> 1 is as follows:","EMMA:                 We’ve got to choose a topic for our experiment, haven’t we, Jack? Were you thinking of <b>something to do</b> with seeds?","JACK:                    That’s right. I thought we could look at <b>seed germination</b> – how a seed begins to grow.","EMMA:                 OK. <b>Any particular</b> reason? I know you’re<b> hoping </b>to work in plant science eventually …","JACK:                    Yeah, but practically <b>everything we do</b> is going to feed into that. No, there’s an optional module on seed structure and function in the <b>third year</b> that I might do, so I thought it might be useful for that (Q21). If I choose that option, I don’t <b>have to do</b> a<b> dissertation </b>module.","EMMA:                 <b>Good idea</b>.","JACK:                    Well, I thought for this experiment we could look at the relationship between seed size and the way the seeds are planted. So, we could plant different sized seeds in <b>different ways</b>, and see which grow best.","EMMA:                 OK. We’d need to allow time for the seeds to <b>come up</b> (Q22).","JACK:                    That should be fine if we start now. A lot of the other possible experiments need <b>quite a bit</b> longer.","EMMA:                 So that’d make it a <b>good one</b> to choose. And I don’t suppose it’d need much equipment; we’re not doing chemical analysis or anything. Though that’s not really an issue, we’ve <b>got plenty</b> of equipment in the laboratory.","JACK:                    Yeah. We <b>need to have</b> a word with the tutor if we’re going to <b>go ahead</b> with it though. I’m sure our aim’s OK. It’s not very ambitious but the assignment’s only <b>ten percent</b> of our final mark, isn’t it? But we need to be sure we’re the <b><b>only one</b>s</b> doing it (Q23).","EMMA:                 Yeah, it’s <b>only five</b> percent actually, but it’d be a bit boring if everyone was doing it.","JACK:                    <b>Did you read</b> that book on <b>seed germination</b> on our <b>reading list</b>?","EMMA:                 The one by Graves? I looked through it for my last experiment, though it wasn’t all that<b> relevant </b>there. It would be for this experiment, though. I found it <b>quite hard</b> to follow – lots about the theory, which I hadn’t expected (Q24)","JACK:                    Yes, I’d been<b> hoping </b>for something more practical. It does include<b> references </b>to the recent findings on genetically-modified seeds, though.","EMMA:                 Yes, that was interesting.","JACK:                    I <b>read an article</b> about <b>seed germination</b> by Lee Hall.","EMMA:                 About seeds that lie in the ground for ages and only<b> germinate </b>after a fire?","JACK:                    That’s the one. I knew a bit about it already, but not about this research. His analysis of figures comparing the times of the fires and the proportion of seeds that<b> germinated </b>was done in a lot of detail – very<b> impressive </b>(Q25).","EMMA:                 Was that the article with the illustrations of early stages of <b>plant development</b>? They were <b>very clear</b>.","JACK:                    I think those diagrams were in <b>another article</b>.","———————–","EMMA:                 Anyway, shall we <b>have a look</b> at the procedure for our experiment? We’ll <b><b>need to get</b> going</b> with it quite soon.","JACK:                    Right. So the <b>first thing</b> we <b>have to do</b> is find our seeds. I think vegetable seeds would be best. And obviously they mustn’t all be the same size. So, how many sorts <b>do we need</b>? About four <b>different ones</b>? (Q26)","EMMA:                 I think that would be enough. There’ll be <b><b>quite a large</b> number</b> of seeds for <b>each one</b>.","JACK:                    Then, for <b>each seed</b> we <b>need to find</b> out how much it weighs (Q27), and also measure its dimensions, and we need to keep a careful record of all that.","EMMA:                 That’ll be quite time-consuming. And we <b>also <b>need to decide</b></b> how deep we’re going to plant the seeds (Q28) – right on the surface, a few millimetres down, or several centimetres.","JACK:                    OK. So then we get planting. <b>Do you think</b> we can plant several seeds together in the same plant pot? (Q29)","EMMA:                 No, I <b>think we need</b> a different <b>one for each</b> seed.","JACK:                    Right. And we’ll need to label them – we can use <b>different coloured</b> labels. Then we wait for the seeds to<b> germinate </b>– I reckon that’ll be about three weeks, depending on what the weather’s like. Then we see if our plants <b>have come</b> up, and <b>write down</b> how tall they’ve grown. (Q30)","EMMA:                 Then all we <b>have to do</b> is look at our numbers, and see if there’s any relation between them.","JACK:                    That’s right. So …","#4 <b>Effect of <b>urban <b>environments on animals</b></b></b> Transcript","The Part 4 <b>audio script</b> of <b>Effect of <b>urban <b>environments on animals</b></b></b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 1 is as follows:","Hi. Today we’re going to be looking at animals in <b>urban environments</b> and I’m going to be <b>telling you about some</b> research on how they’re affected by these environments.","Now, in evolutionary terms, <b>urban environments</b> represent huge upheavals, the sorts of massive changes that usually happen over <b>millions of years</b>. And we used to think that <b>only a few</b><b> species </b>could adapt to this new environment. <b>One species</b> which is <b>well known</b> as being <b>highly adaptable</b> is the crow, and there’ve been <b>various studies</b> about how they manage to learn <b>new skills</b> (Q31). Another successful<b> species </b>is the pigeon, because they’re able to<b> perch </b>on<b> ledges </b>on the walls of city buildings, <b>just like</b> they once<b> perched </b>on cliffs by the sea. (Q32).","But in fact, we’re now finding that these early immigrants were just the start of a more general <b>movement of animals</b> into cities, and of adaptation by these animals to <b>city life</b>. And <b>one thing</b> that researchers are finding especially interesting is the speed with which they’re doing this – we’re not talking about gradual evolution here – these animals are changing fast. (Q33)","<b>Let <b>me <b>tell you about some</b></b></b> of the studies that <b>have been carried</b> out in this area. So, in the University of Minnesota, a <b>biologist called</b> Emilie Snell-Rood and her <b>colleagues looked</b> at<b> specimens </b>of<b> urbanised </b><b>small mammals</b> such as<b> mice </b>and<b> gophers </b>that had been collected in Minnesota, and that are now kept in museums there.","And she found that during that time, these <b>small mammals</b> had experienced a jump in brain size when compared to rural mammals (Q34). Now, we can’t be sure this means they’re more intelligent, but since the sizes of <b>other parts</b> of the body didn’t change, it <b>does suggest</b> that something cognitive was going on. And Snell-Rood thinks that this change might reflect the cognitive demands of adjusting to <b>city life</b> – having to look in <b>different places</b> to find food, for example, and coping with a <b>whole new</b> set of dangers. (Q35)","Then over in Germany at the Max Planck Institute, there’s another <b>biologist called</b> Catarina Miranda who’s <b>done some</b> experiments with<b> blackbirds </b>living in <b>urban and rural</b> areas. And she’s been looking not at their anatomy but at their behaviour (Q36). So as you might expect, she’s found that the urban<b> blackbirds </b>tend to be quite bold – they’re prepared to face up to a lot of threats that would<b> frighten </b>away their country counterparts. But there’s <b>one type</b> of situation that <b>does seem</b> to<b> frighten </b>the urban blackbirds, and that’s anything new – anything they haven’t experienced before (Q37). And if you think about it, that’s quite<b> sensible </b>for a bird living in the city.","——————","Jonathan Atwell, in Indiana University, is <b>looking at how a range</b> of animals respond to <b>urban environments</b>. He’s found that when they’re under stress, their<b> endocrine </b>systems react by reducing the amount of<b> hormones </b>such as<b> corticosterone </b>into their blood (Q38). It’s a sensible-seeming adaptation. A rat that gets<b> scared </b><b>every time</b> a subway train rolls past won’t be <b>very successful</b>.","There’s <b>just one</b> more study I’d <b>like to mention</b> which is by Sarah Partan and her team, and they’ve been looking at how<b> squirrels </b>communicate in an urban environment, and they’ve found that a routine part of their communication is carried out by waving their tails (Q39). You do <b>also see</b> this in the country, but it’s much more<b> prevalent </b>in cities, <b>possibly because</b> it’s effective in a noisy environment.","So what are the long-term implications of this? <b>One possibility</b> is that we may see <b><b>completely new</b> species</b> developing in cities. But on the other hand, it’s possible that not all of these adaptations will be permanent (Q40)."]},{"name":"ALS/13-2","paragraph":["<h2>#1 South City Cycling Club Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of <b><b>South <b>City Cycling</b></b> Club</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 2 is as follows:","JIM:                      Hello, <b><b>South <b>City Cycling</b></b> Club</b>.","WOMAN:             Oh, hi.

I’m the club<b> secretary </b>and my name’s Jim Hunter (Example).","WOMAN:             Oh, hi Jim.","JIM:                      So, are you interested in membership for yourself?","WOMAN:             That’s right.","JIM:                      OK. Well there are basically <b>two types</b> of adult membership. If you’re pretty serious about cycling, there’s the <b>Full membership</b>. That costs 260 dollars and that covers you not just for ordinary cycling but also for races both <b>here in the city</b> and <b>also in other</b> parts of Australia. (Q1)","WOMAN:             Right. Well, I’m not <b>really up</b> to that standard. I was more interested in just joining a group to <b>do some</b> cycling in my <b>free time</b>.","JIM:                      Sure. That’s why <b>most people</b> join. So, in that case you’d be better with the Recreational membership. That’s 108 dollars if you’re over 19, and 95 dollars if you’re under.","WOMAN:             I’m 25.","JIM:                      OK. It’s paid quarterly, and you can upgrade it later to the <b>Full membership</b> if you want to, of course. Now both <b>types of membership</b> include the club fee of 20 dollars. They <b>also provide</b> insurance in case you <b>have an accident</b> (Q2), though we hope you won’t need that, of course.","WOMAN:             No. OK, well, I’ll go with the Recreational membership, I think. And that allows me to join in the club activities, and so on?","JIM:                      That’s right. And once you’re a member of the club, you’re also<b> permitted </b>to wear our kit when you’re out cycling. It’s green and white.","WOMAN:             Yes, I’ve seen cyclists wearing it. So, can I buy that at the club?","JIM:                      No, it’s made to order by a company in Brisbane. You can find them online: they’re called Jerriz (Q3). That’s J-E-R-R-I-Z. You can use your membership number to <b>put in an order</b> on their website.","WOMAN:             OK. Now, can you <b>tell <b>me a bit</b></b> about the rides I can do?","JIM:                      Sure. So we <b>have training</b> rides <b>pretty well</b> every morning, and they’re a <b><b>really good</b> way</b> of improving your <b>cycling skills</b> as well as your <b>general level</b> of fitness, but they’re <b>different levels</b>. Level A is <b>pretty fast</b> – you’re looking at about 30 or 35 kilometres an hour. If you can do about 25 kilometres an hour, you’d probably be <b>level B</b> (Q4), and then level C are the novices, who stay at about 15 <b><b>kilometres per</b> hour</b>.","WOMAN:             Right. Well I reckon I’d be <b>level B</b>. So, when are the sessions for that level?","JIM:                      There are a couple <b>each week</b>. They’re both <b>early morning</b> sessions. There’s one on Tuesdays, and for that one you meet at 5.30 am, and the meeting point’s the<b> stadium </b>(Q5) – <b>do you know</b> where that is?","WOMAN:             Yes, it’s <b>quite near</b> my home, in fact. OK, and how about the <b>other one</b>?","JIM:                      That’s on Thursdays. It starts at the <b>same time</b>, but they meet at the main gate to the park. (Q6)","WOMAN:             Is that the <b>one just</b> past the shopping mall?","JIM:                      That’s it.","————————–","WOMAN:             So how long are the rides?","JIM:                      They’re about an <b>hour and a half</b>. So, if you have a job it’s easy to fit in before you go to work. And the <b>members often</b> <b>go somewhere</b> for coffee afterwards (Q7), so it’s quite a<b> social </b>event.","WOMAN:             OK. That <b>sounds good</b>. I’ve <b>only just</b> moved to the city so I don’t actually know <b>many people</b> yet.","JIM:                      Well, it’s a great way to meet people.","WOMAN:             And does <b>each ride</b> have a leader? (Q8)","JIM:                      Sometimes, but not always. But you don’t <b>really need</b> one; the group members on the ride support <b>one another</b>, anyway.","WOMAN:             How would we know where to go?","JIM:                      If you check the club website, you’ll see that the route for <b>each ride</b> is clearly marked. So you can just print that out (Q9) and take it along with you. It’s similar from one week to another, but it’s not always <b>exactly the same</b>.","WOMAN:             And what do I <b>need to bring</b>?","JIM:                      Well, bring a bottle of water, and your phone.

OK, so this meeting is for <b>new staff</b> and staff who haven’t been involved with our <b>volunteering projects</b> yet. So basically, the idea is that we allow staff to <b>give up</b> some of their work <b>time to help</b> on various charity projects to benefit the <b>local community</b>. We’ve been doing this for the last <b>five years</b> and it’s been <b>very successful</b>.","Participating doesn’t necessarily involve a huge time commitment. The <b>company will pay</b> for <b>eight hours</b> of your time. That can be used over <b><b>one or two</b> days</b> all at once, or spread over several months <b>throughout the year</b> (Q11). T<b>here are some</b> staff who enjoy volunteering so much they <b>also give</b> <b>up their own</b> <b>free time</b> for a <b>couple of hours</b> every week. It’s completely up to you. Obviously, <b>many people</b> will have family commitments and aren’t as available as <b>other <b>members of staff</b></b>.","Feedback from staff has been<b> overwhelmingly </b>positive. Because they felt they were <b><b>doing some</b>thing</b> <b>really useful</b>, <b>nearly everyone</b> agreed that volunteering made them feel more motivated at work (Q12). They <b>also like</b>d building relationships with the people in the <b>local community</b> and felt valued by them. <b><b>One or two</b> people</b> <b>also said</b> it was a <b>good thing</b> to have on their CVs.","<b><b>One part</b>icular</b>ly <b>successful project</b> <b>last year</b> was the Get Working Project. This was aimed at helping unemployed <b>people in the area</b> <b>get back</b> to work. Our staff were <b>able to help</b> them improve their telephone skills, such as <b>writing down</b> messages and speaking with confidence to <b>potential customers</b>, which they <b>had found</b> <b>quite difficult</b> (Q13). This is something <b>many employers</b> look for in job applicants – and something we all do without even thinking about, <b>every day</b> at work.","We’ve got an <b>exciting new</b> project starting this year. <b>Up until</b> now, we’re mainly focused on projects to do with education and training. And we’ll continue with out reading project in schools and our work with local charities. But we’re also agreed to help out on a conservation project in Redfern Park (Q14). So if any of you fancy being outside and getting your hands dirty, this is the project for you.","<b>I </b> <b>also <b>want to mention</b></b> the annual <b>Digital Inclusion</b> Day, which is <b>coming up</b> <b>next month</b>. The aim of this is to help <b>older people</b> keep <b>up with technology</b>. And this year, instead of hosting the event in our own training facility, we’re using the ICT suite at Hill College (Q15), as it can hold <b>far more people</b>.","We’ve invited over 60 people from the Silver Age <b>Community Centre</b> to <b>take part</b>, so we’ll <b>need a lot</b> of volunteers to help with this event.","If you’re interested in <b>taking part</b>, please go to the volunteering section of our website and complete the<b> relevant </b>form (Q16). We won’t be <b>providing any</b> training for this but you’ll be paired with an experienced volunteer if you’ve never done it before. By the way, don’t <b>forget to tell</b> your manager about any volunteering activities you decide to do.","——————","The participants on the <b>Digital Inclusion</b> Day <b>really benefit</b>ed. The majority were in their seventies, though some where younger and a few were even in their nineties! <b>Quite a few</b> owned both a computer and a mobile phone, but these tended to be outdated model (Q17). They generally knew how to do simple things, like send texts, but weren’t aware of recent developments in mobile phone technology. A few were <b>keen to learn</b> but most were quite<b> dismissive </b>at first – they couldn’t see the point of updating their skills (Q18). But that soon changed.","The feedback was <b>very positive</b>. The really encouraging thing was that participants all <b>said they felt</b> much more confident about using <b>social media</b> to keep in touch with their grandchildren (Q19), who prefer this <b>form of communication</b> to phoning or sending emails. A lot of them <b>also said</b> playing online games would help them make <b>new friends</b> and keep their brains active (Q20). They weren’t that impressed with being able to order their<b> groceries </b>online, as they liked going out to the shops, but some said it would come in handy if they were ill or the weather was <b>really bad</b>.","#3 <b>Presentation on Nanotechnology</b> Transcript","The Part 3 <b>audio <b>transcript of Presentation</b></b> on<b> Nanotechnology </b>in Cambridge 13 <b>Listening Test</b> 2 is as follows:","TUTOR:                Ah … come in, Russ.","RUSS:                   Thank you.","TUTOR:                Now you wanted to consult me about your class <b>presentation on nanotechnology</b> – you’re <b>due to give</b> it in <b>next week</b>, aren’t you?","RUSS:                   That’s right. And I’m really struggling. Should I assume the <b>other students</b> don’t <b>know much</b>, and give them a kind of general introduction, or should I try and make them share my fascination with a <b>particular aspect</b>? (Q21)","TUTOR:                You could do either, but you’ll <b>need to have</b> it clear in your own mind.","RUSS:                   Then I think I’ll give an overview.","TUTOR:                OK. Now, <b>one way</b> of approaching this is to work through developments in <b>chronological order</b>.","RUSS:                   Uh-huh.","TUTOR:                On the other hand, you could talk about the<b> numerous </b>ways that<b> nanotechnology </b>is being applied.","RUSS:                   You <b><b>mean things</b> like</b> thin films on camera displays to make them water-repellent, and additives to make motorcycle helmets stronger and lighter.","TUTOR:                Exactly. Or <b>another way</b> would be to focus on its impact in one <b>particular area</b> (Q22), say medicine, or space exploration.","RUSS:                   That would <b>make it easier</b> to focus. Perhaps I should do that.","TUTOR:                I think that would be a <b>good idea</b>.","RUSS:                   Right. How important is it to include slides in the presentation?","TUTOR:                They aren’t essential, by any means. And there’s a danger of tailoring what you say to fit whatever slides you can find. While it can be good to includes slides, you could end <b>up spending</b> <b>too long</b> <b>looking for suitable</b> ones. You might find it better to leave them out. (Q23)","RUSS:                   I see. <b>Another thing</b> I was wondering about was how to start. I know presentations often begin with ‘First I’m <b>going to talk</b> about this, and then I’ll talk about that’, but I thought about asking the audience what they know about nanotechnology.","TUTOR:                That would be fine if you had an <b>hour or two</b> for the presentation, but you might find that you can’t <b><b>do any</b>thing</b> with the answers you get, and it simply eats into the <b>short time</b> that’s available.","RUSS:                   So, maybe I should mention a particular way that<b> nanotechnology </b>is used, to focus people’s attention. (Q24)","TUTOR:                That <b>sounds sensible</b>.","RUSS:                   What <b>do you think</b> I should <b>do next</b>? I really <b>have to plan</b> the presentation today and tomorrow.","TUTOR:                Well, initially I think you should ignore all the notes you’ve made, take a small piece of paper, and write a single short sentence that ties together the whole presentation (Q25): it can be <b>something as simple</b> as ‘Nanotechnology is already improving our lives’. Then <b>start planning</b> the content around that. You can always modify that sentence later, if you need to.","RUSS:                   OK.","————————————","TUTOR:                OK, <b>now let</b>’s think about actually giving the presentation.","RUSS:                   That’s right. It was pretty rubbish!","TUTOR:                Let’s say it was <b>better in some</b> respects than in others. With regard to the structure. I felt that you ended rather abruptly, without rounding it off (Q26). Be careful not to do that in <b>next week</b>’s presentation.","RUSS:                   OK.","TUTOR:                And you made <b>very little</b> <b>eye contact</b> with the audience, because you were looking down at your notes <b>most of the time</b>. You need to be looking at the audience and only occasionally glancing at your notes. (Q27)","RUSS:                   Mmm.","TUTOR:                Your body language was a little odd. <b>Every time</b> you showed a slide, you turned your back on the audience so you could look at it – you should have been looking at your laptop. And you kept<b> scratching </b>your head, so I found myself wondering when you were next <b>going to do</b> that, <b>instead of listening</b> to what you were saying! (Q28)","RUSS:                   <b>Oh dear</b>. What <b>did you think</b> of the language? I knew that not everyone was familiar with the subject, so I tried to make it as simple as I could.","TUTOR:                Yes, that <b>came across</b>. You used a <b>few words</b> that are specific to the field, but you always explained what they meant, so the audience wouldn’t <b>have had</b> any <b>difficulty understanding</b>. (Q29)","RUSS:                   Uh-huh.","TUTOR:                I must say the handouts you prepared were well thought out. They were a good summary of your presentation, which people would be able to refer to later on (Q30). So well done on that.","RUSS:                   Thank you.","TUTOR:                Well, I hope that helps you with <b>next week</b>’s presentation.","RUSS:                   Yes, it will. <b>Thanks a lot</b>.","TUTOR:                I’ll <b>look <b>forward to seeing</b></b> a big improvement, then.","#4 <b>Episodic Memory</b> Transcript","The Part 4 <b>audio script</b> of <b>Episodic Memory</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 2 is as follows:","Today, we’ll be continuing the <b>series of lectures</b> on memory by focusing on what is called <b>episodic memory</b> and what can happen if this is not working properly.","<b>Episodic memory</b><b> refers </b>to the memory of an event or ‘episode’. They allow us to <b><b>mentally travel</b> back</b> in time to an event from the past. These include various details about these events, for example, when an event happened and <b>other information</b> such as the location (Q31). To help understand this concept, try to remember the <b>last time</b> you ate dinner at a restaurant. The ability to remember where you ate, who you were with and the items you ordered are all features of an <b>episodic memory</b>.","<b>Episodic memory</b> is distinct from <b>another type</b> of memory called <b>semantic memory</b>. This is the type of<b> factual </b>memory that we have in common with everyone else – that is your <b>general knowledge</b> of the world (Q32). To <b>build up</b>on a previous example, remembering where you <b>parked your car</b> is an example of <b>episodic memory</b>, but your understanding of what a car is and how an engine works are examples of<b> sematic </b>memory. Unlike <b>episodic memory</b>, <b>semantic memory</b> isn’t dependent on recalling personal experiences. (Q33)","<b>Episodic memory</b> can be thought of as a process with <b>several different</b> steps of memory processing: encoding,<b> consolidation </b>and retrieval.","The initial step is called encoding. This involves the process of receiving and registering information, which is necessary for creating memories of information or events that you experience. The degree to which you can successfully encode information depends on the level of attention you give to an event while it’s actually happening (Q34). Being distracted can make effective encoding <b>very difficult</b>. Encoding of <b>episodic memories</b> is also influenced by how you process the event. For example, if you were introduced to someone called Charlie, you might make the connection that your uncle has the <b>same name</b>. Future<b> recollection </b>of Charlie’s name is <b>much easier</b> if you have a strategy to help you encode it. (Q35)","Memory consolidation, the next <b>step in forming</b> an <b>episodic memory</b>, is the process by which memories of <b>encoded information</b> are strengthened,<b> stabilised </b>and stored to<b> facilitate </b><b>later retrieval</b>.<b> Consolidation </b>is <b>most effective</b> when the information being stored can be linked to an existing network of information (Q36).<b> Consolidation </b>makes it possible for you to store memories for <b>later retrieval</b> indefinitely. Forming strong memories depends on the frequency with which you try to retrieve them (Q37).","The last <b>step in forming</b> <b>episodic memories</b> is called retrieval, which is the conscious<b> recollection </b>of <b>encoded information</b>. Retrieving information from <b>episodic memory</b> depends upon semantic, olfactory,<b> auditory </b>and visual factors. These help <b>episodic memory</b><b> retrieval </b>by acting as a prompt. For example, when recalling where you <b>parked your car</b> you may use the colour of a sign close to where you parked (Q38). You <b>actually have</b> to <b><b>mentally travel</b> back</b> to the moment you parked.","——————","There are a <b>wide range</b> of<b> neurological </b>diseases and conditions that can affect <b>episodic memory</b>. These range from Alzheimer’s to<b> schizophrenia </b>to autism. An<b> impairment </b>of <b>episodic memory</b> can have a profound effect on individuals’ lives. For example, the<b> symptoms </b>of<b> schizophrenia </b>can be reasonably well controlled by medication; however, patients’ <b>episodic memory</b> may still be<b> impaired </b>and so they are often unable to return to university or work. Recent <b><b>studies have</b> shown</b> that computer- assisted games designed to keep the brain active can <b>help improve</b> their <b>episodic memory</b>. (Q39)","<b>Episodic memories</b> can <b>help people</b> connect with others, for instance by sharing<b> intimate </b>details about their past; something individuals with<b> autism </b>often <b>have problems</b> with. This may be caused by an absence of a sense of self (Q40). This is essential for the storage of <b>episodic memory</b>, and <b>has been found</b> to be<b> impaired </b>in children with autism. <b><b>Research has</b> shown</b> that treatments that improve memory may <b>also have</b> a <b>positive impact</b> on children’s<b> social </b>development.","<b>One study</b> looked at a …"]},{"name":"ALS/13-3","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Moving to Branford City Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of <b><b>Moving to Branford</b> City</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 3 is as follows:","LINDA:  Hello, Linda speaking.","MATT:   Oh hi, Linda.

The first question to <b>ask yourself</b> is whether you would enjoy training in a gym. <b>Many people</b> are put off by the <b>idea of having</b> to fit a visit to the gym into their <b>busy day</b>. You often <b>have to go</b> <b>very early</b> or late as some gyms can <b>get very</b> crowded but with regular training you’ll see a <b>big difference</b> in a <b>relatively short</b> space of time. (Q11)","Running <b>has become</b> incredibly <b>popular in recent</b> years. That’s <b>probably got</b> a <b>lot to do</b> with the fact that it’s a very accessible form of exercise that anyone can run even if you could only run a few meters to begin with (Q12). But <b>make <b>sure you get</b></b> the right shoes. It’s worth investing in a <b>high quality</b> pair and they don’t come cheap. Another great thing about running is that you can do it at <b>any time</b> of day or night. The <b>only thing</b> that may stop you is snow and ice.","Swimming is another <b><b>really good</b> way</b> to build fitness. What attracts <b>many people</b> is that you can swim in an indoor pool at any <b>time of year</b> (Q13). On the other hand, it can be quite boring or solitary. It’s hard to chat to people while you’re swimming lengths.","Cycling <b>has become</b> almost as popular as running in <b>recent years</b>. That’s <b>probably because</b> as well as <b>improving their fitness</b> <b>many people</b> say being out in the <b>fresh air</b> in a park or in the countryside can be fun (Q14), provided the conditions are right of course. Only<b> fanatics </b>go out in the wind and rain.","Yoga is a <b>good choice</b> for those of you looking for exercise, which focuses on developing both a healthy <b>mind and body</b>. It’s a <b>good way</b> of building strength and with the right instructor there’s less chance of hurting yourself than with other more active sports. But don’t <b>expect to find</b> it easy. It can be surprisingly challenging, especially for people who aren’t very flexible. Getting a <b>personal trainer</b> is a <b>good way</b> to start your fitness program. Obviously there can be significant costs involved. But if you’ve <b>got some</b>one there to encourage you and <b>help you achieve</b> your goals, you’re <b>less likely</b> to <b>give up</b>. <b>Make <b>sure you get</b></b> someone with a recognised qualification though. Or you could do yourself <b>permanent damage</b>. (Q15&Q16)","—————–","Whatever you do, don’t join a gym and you’re sure you’ll make good use of it. So <b>many people</b> waste lots of money by signing up for membership and then <b>hardly ever</b> go. What happens to their good intentions? I don’t <b>think people</b> suddenly stop caring about <b>improving their fitness</b> or decide they have more <b>important thing</b>s to do. I <b>think people</b> lose interest when they don’t think they’re making enough progress. That’s when they <b>give up</b> hope and stop believing they’ll ever achieve their goals. Also, what people sometimes don’t realize when they start is that it <b>takes a lot</b> of determination and <b>hard work</b> to keep training week after week, and <b>lots of people</b> don’t have that kind of commitment (Q17&Q18). <b>One thing</b> you can <b>do to help</b> yourself is to set<b> manageable </b>goals (Q19), be realistic and don’t push yourself <b>too far</b>. <b>Some people</b> advise writing goes down but I think it’s better to have a flexible approach. <b>Give yourself</b> a <b>really nice</b> treat <b>every time</b> you r<b>each one</b> of your goals (Q20) and don’t <b>get too</b> upset if you experience setbacks. It’s a journey. There are bound to be difficulties along the way.","#3 <b>Using <b>natural <b>dyes to <b>colour fabrics</b></b></b></b> Transcript","The Part 3 <b>audio transcript</b> of <b>Using <b>natural <b>dyes to <b>colour fabrics</b></b></b></b> in Cambridge 13 <b>Listening Test</b> 3 is as follows:","TUTOR:                OK, Jim. You <b>wanted to see</b> me about your<b> textile </b>design project.","JIM:                      That’s right. I’ve been <b>looking at how a range</b> of <b>natural dyes</b> can be used to <b>colour fabrics</b> like <b>cotton and wool</b>.","TUTOR:                Why <b>did you choose</b> that topic?","JIM:                      Well, I <b>got a lot</b> of useful ideas from the museum, you know, at that exhibition of textiles. But I’ve <b>always been interested</b> in anything to do with colour. <b>Years ago</b>, I went to a<b> carpet </b>shop with my parents when we were on holiday in Turkey, and I remember all the amazing colours. (Q21)","TUTOR:                They might not <b>all have</b> been <b>natural dyes</b>.","JIM:                      Maybe not, but for the project I decided to follow it up. And I found a great book about a botanic garden in California that specialises in <b>plants used</b> for dyes.","TUTOR:                OK. So, in your project, you had to include a practical investigation.","JIM:                      Yeah. At first I couldn’t decide on my variables. I was going to <b>just look</b> at <b>one type</b> of<b> fibre </b>for example, <b>like cotton</b> …","TUTOR:                … and see how <b>different types</b> of dyes affected it?","JIM:                      Yes. Then I decided to include others as well, so I looked at <b>cotton and wool</b> and nylon. (Q22)","TUTOR:                With <b>just one</b> type of dye?","JIM:                      Various types, including some that weren’t natural, for comparison.","TUTOR:                OK.","JIM:                      So, I did the experiments <b>last week</b>. I used some ready-made <b>natural dyes</b>. I found a website which supplied them, they came in <b>just a few</b> days, but I <b>also made</b> some of my own.","TUTOR:                That must <b>have taken</b> <b>quite a bit</b> of time.","JIM:                      Yes, I’d thought it’d just be a matter of a<b> teaspoon </b>or so of dye, and actually that wasn’t the case at all. Like I was using one vegetable, beetroot, for a red dye, and I had to <b>chop up</b> a whole pile of it (Q23). So it <b>all too</b>k longer than I’d expected.","TUTOR:                <b>One possibility</b> is to use food colourings.","JIM:                      I did use one. That was a yellow dye, an artificial one.","TUTOR:                Tartrazine?","JIM:                      Yeah. I used it on cotton first. It came out a great colour, but when I<b> rinsed </b>the material, the colour just <b>washed away</b> (Q24). I’d been going to try it out on nylon, but I abandoned that idea.","TUTOR:                Were you worried about <b>health issues</b>?","JIM:                      I’d thought if it’s a legal food colouring, it must be safe.","TUTOR:                Well, it can occasionally cause allergic reactions, I believe.","———————–","TUTOR:                So what <b>natural dyes</b> did you look at?","JIM:                      Well, one was turmeric. The colour’s great, it’s a really strong yellow. It’s generally used in dishes like curry.","TUTOR:                It’s meant to be <b>quite good</b> for your health when eaten, but you might find it’s not permanent when it’s <b>used as a dye</b> – a few washes, and it’s gone. (Q25)","JIM:                      Right. I used<b> beetroot </b>as a<b> dye </b>for wool. When I <b>chop up</b><b> beetroot </b>to eat I always <b>end up</b> with bright red hands, but the<b> wool </b><b>ended up</b> just a sort of<b> watery </b>cream shade (Q26). Disappointing.","TUTOR:                There’s a natural<b> dye </b>called Tyrian purple. Have you heard of that?","JIM:                      Yes. It comes from a shellfish, and it was worn in <b>ancient times</b> but only by important people as it was so rare. I didn’t use it. (Q27)","TUTOR:                It <b>fell out of use</b> centuries ago, though one researcher <b>managed to get</b> hold of <b>some recent</b>ly. But that shade of purple can be produced by chemical dyes nowadays. Did you <b>use any</b> black dyes?","JIM:                      Logwood. That was quite complicated. I had to prepare the fabric so the<b> dye </b>would take.","TUTOR:                I hope you were careful to wear gloves.","JIM:                      Yes. I know the danger with that dye.","TUTOR:                Good. It can be extremely dangerous if it’s<b> ingested </b>(Q28). Now,<b> presumably </b>you <b>had a look</b> at an insect-based dye? Like cochineal, for example?","JIM:                      Yes. I didn’t <b>actually make</b> that, I didn’t have <b>time to start</b><b> crushing </b>up insects to get the red colour and anyway they’re not available here, but I <b>managed to get</b> the<b> dye </b>quite easily from a website. But it cost a fortune (Q29). I can see why it’s generally just used in cooking, and in <b>small quantities</b>.","TUTOR:                Yes, it’s very effective, but that’s precisely why it’s not <b>used as a dye</b>.","JIM:                      I <b>also read</b> about using metal oxide. Apparently you can allow iron to<b> rust </b>while it’s in contact with the fabric, and that colours it.","TUTOR:                Yes, that <b>works well</b> for<b> dying </b>cotton. But you have to be careful as the metal can actually affect the fabric (Q30) and so you can’t expect to get a lot of wear out of fabrics treated in this way. And the colours are quite subtle, not everyone likes them. Anyway, it looks as if you’ve done a lot of work …","#4 The <b>Sleepy Lizard</b> Transcript","The Part 4 <b>audio script</b> of The <b>Sleepy Lizard</b> (Tiliqua Rugosa) in <b>Listening Test</b> 3 is as follows:","<b>Last week</b>, we <b>started looking</b> at reptiles, including<b> crocodiles </b>and snakes. Today, I’d like us to <b>have a look</b> at another<b> reptile </b>– the<b> lizard </b>– and in particular, at some <b>studies that have</b> been done on a <b>particular type</b> of<b> lizard </b>whose Latin name is<b> tiliqua </b>rugosa. This is <b>commonly known</b> as the <b>sleepy lizard</b>, because it’s quite slow in its movements and spends <b>quite a lot</b> of its time dozing under rocks or <b>lying in the sun</b>.","I’ll start with a general description. <b><b>Sleepy lizard</b>s</b> live in Western and South Australia, where they’re quite common. Unlike European lizards, which are mostly small, green and fast-moving, <b><b>sleepy lizard</b>s</b> are brown, but what’s particularly distinctive about them is the colour of their tongue, which is dark blue (Q31), in contrast with the lining of their mouth which is bright pink. And they’re <b>much bigger</b> than most European lizards. They <b>have quite</b> a varied diet, including insects and even small animals, but they mostly eat plants of varying kinds. (Q32)","<b>Even though</b> they’re quite large and powerful, with strong<b> jaws </b>that can<b> crush </b>beetles and snail shells, they still <b>have quite</b> a <b>few predators</b>. Large <b>birds like</b><b> cassowaries </b>were <b>one of the main</b> ones in the past, but nowadays they’re more likely to be caught and killed by snakes (Q33). Actually, another <b>threat to their survival</b> isn’t a predator at all, but is man-made – <b><b>quite a large</b> number</b> of <b><b>sleepy lizard</b>s</b> are killed by cars when they’re trying to cross highways.","One <b>study carried</b> out by Michael Freake at Flinders University investigated the methods of navigation of these lizards. Though they move slowly, they can travel quite <b>long distances</b>. And he <b>found that even</b> if they were taken <b>some distance</b> away from their home territory, they could usually <b>find their way</b> <b>back home</b> as long as they could see the sky – they didn’t need <b>any other</b> landmarks on the ground. (Q34)","———————","Observations of these <b>lizards in the wild</b> <b>have also</b> revealed that their<b> mating </b>habits are quite unusual. Unlike most animals, it seems that they’re relatively monogamous, returning to the same partner year after year (Q35). And the male and female also stay together for a <b>long time</b>, <b>both before and after the birth</b> of their young.","It’s <b>quite interesting</b> to think about the <b>possible reason</b>s for this. It could be that it’s to do with protecting their young – you’d expect them to have a <b>much better</b> chance of survival if they <b>have both</b> parents around. But in fact observers <b>have no</b>ted that once the babies have<b> hatched </b>out of their eggs, they <b>have hardly</b> any contact with their parents (Q36). So, there’s not really any <b>evidence to support</b> that idea.","Another suggestion’s based on the observation that <b>male lizards</b> in<b> monogamous </b>relationships tend to be bigger and stronger than <b>other males</b>. So maybe the <b>male lizards</b> stay around so they can give the fe<b>male lizards</b> protection from <b>other males</b> (Q37). But again, we’re not really sure.","Finally, I’d <b>like to mention</b> <b>another study</b> that involved collecting data by tracking the lizards. I was actually involved in this myself. So we caught some <b>lizards in the wild</b> and we developed a tiny GPS system that would allow us to track them, and we fixed this onto their tails (Q38). Then we set the<b> lizards </b>free again, and we were <b>able to track</b> them for <b>twelve days</b> and gather data, not just about their location, but even about how many steps they took during this period. (Q39)","One surprising thing we discovered from this is that there were <b>far fewer</b> meetings between<b> lizards </b>than we expected – it seems that they were actually <b>trying to avoid</b> <b>one another</b>. So why would that be? Well, again we have <b>no clear</b> evidence, but one<b> hypothesis </b>is that <b>male lizards</b> can cause quite serious injuries to <b>one another</b>, so maybe this avoidance is a way of preventing this (Q40) – of self-preservation, if you like. But we need to collect a lot more data before we can be sure of any of this."]},{"name":"ALS/13-4","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Alex’s Training Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of Alex’s Training in <b>Listening Test</b> 4 is as follows:","MARTHA:             Hi Alex.

I stayed there for the first <b>two years</b> and then moved to where I am now.","MARTHA:             That’s the same department I’m applying for. Did you enjoy it?","ALEX:                    I was pretty nervous to begin with. I didn’t do well in my exams at school and I was really <b>worried because</b> I failed Maths (Q2). But it didn’t actually matter because I did lots of courses on the job.","MARTHA:             <b>Did you get</b> a<b> diploma </b>at the end of your<b> trainee </b>period? I’m<b> hoping </b>to do the one in <b>business skills</b>.","ALEX:                    Yes. That <b>sounds good</b>. I took the one on IT skills but I wish I’d done that one instead. (Q3)","MARTHA:             OK, that’s <b>good to know</b>. What about the other trainees? How <b>did you get</b> on with them?","ALEX:                    There were about 20 of us who started at the <b>same time</b> and we were all around the same age – I was 18 and there was only <b>one person</b> younger than me, how was 17 (Q4). The rest were between 18 and 20. I <b>made some</b> good friends.","MARTHA:             I’ve heard <b>lots of good</b> things about the training at JPNW. It <b>seems like</b> there are a lot of<b> opportunities </b>there.","ALEX:                    Yeah, definitely. Because of its size you can work in loads of <b>different areas</b> within the organisation.","MARTHA:             What about pay? I know you get a lower <b>minimum wage</b> than regular employees.","ALEX:                    That’s right – which isn’t great. Buy you get the same number of days’ holiday as everyone else (Q5). And the pay goes up massively if they offer you a job at the end of the training period.","MARTHA:             Yeah, but I’m not doing it for the money – it’s the experience I think will be <b>really useful</b>. Everyone says by the <b>end of the year</b> you gain so much confidence.","ALEX:                    You’re right. That’s the <b>most useful</b> part about it. There’s a <b>lot of variety</b> too. You’re given lots of <b><b>different things</b> to do</b>. I enjoyed it all – I didn’t even mind the studying.","MARTHA:             <b>Do you have</b> to spend <b>any time</b> in college?","ALEX:                    Yes, <b>one day</b> <b>each month</b> (Q6). So you get lots of support from both your tutor and your manager.","MARTHA:             That’s good. And the company is <b>easy to get</b> to, isn’t it?","ALEX:                    Yes, it’s <b>very close</b> to the train station so the location’s a real advantage. (Q7)","———————-","ALEX:                    <b>Have you got</b> a date for your interview yet?","MARTHA:             Yes, it’s on the 23rd of this month.","ALEX:                    So long as you’re <b>well prepared</b> there’s nothing to worry about. Everyone’s very friendly.","MARTHA:             I am not sure what I should wear. What <b>do you think</b>?","ALEX:                    <b>Nothing too</b> casual – <b>like jeans</b> (Q8), for example. If you’ve got a nice jacket, wear that with a skirt or trousers.","MARTHA:             OK. Thanks. <b>Any other</b> tips?","ALEX:                    Erm, well I know it’s really obvious but arrive in <b>plenty of time</b> (Q9). They hate people who are late. So <b>make <b>sure you know</b></b> exactly where you have to get to. And one other useful piece of advice my manager <b>told me</b> before I had the interview for this job – is to smile (Q10). <b>Even if you feel</b> terrified. It <b>makes people</b> respond better to you.","MARTHA:             I’ll have to practise doing that in the mirror!","ALEX:                    Yeah – well, <b>good luck</b>. <b>Let <b>me know</b></b> if you <b>need any</b> more information.","MARTHA:             <b><b>Thanks very</b> much</b>.","#2 The Snow <b>Centre Transcript</b>","The Part 2 <b>audio transcript</b> of The <b>Snow Centre</b> in Cambridge 13 <b>Listening Test</b> 4 is as follows:","Hi everyone, welcome to the <b>Snow Centre</b>. My name’s Annie. I hope you enjoyed the bus trip from the airport – we’ve certainly <b>got plenty</b> of snow today! Well, you’ve come to <b>New Zealand</b>’s<b> premier </b>snow and<b> ski </b>centre, and we’ve a whole load of activities for you during your week here.","<b>Most visitors</b> <b>come here</b> for the cross-country skiing, where you’re on fairly flat ground for <b>most of the time</b>, rather than <b>going down</b><b> steep </b>mountainsides. There are marked trails, but you can also leave these and go off on your own and that’s an experience not to be missed (Q11). You can go at your own speed – it’s great <b>aerobic exercise</b> if you really push yourself, or if you prefer you can just glide gently along and enjoy the beautiful scenery.","This afternoon, you’ll be going on a dog-sled trip. You may <b>have seen</b> our dogs on TV recently racing in the winter<b> sled </b>festival. If you want, you can <b>have your own</b> team for the afternoon and learn how to drive them (Q12), following behind our leader on the trail. Or if you’d prefer, you can <b><b>just sit</b> back</b> in the<b> sled </b>and enjoy the ride as a passenger.","At the weekend, we have the team relay event, and you’re all <b>welcome to join</b> in. We <b>have a local</b> school coming along, and a lot of the teachers are <b>taking part</b> too. Participation rather than winning is the main focus, and there’s a medal for everyone who <b>takes part</b> (Q13). Participants are in teams of two to four, and <b>each team</b> must complete four laps of the course.","For your final expedition, you’ll head off to <b>Mount Frenner</b> wearing a pair of special snow shoes which allow you to walk on top of the snow. This is an area where miners once searched for gold, though there are <b>very few</b> traces of their work left now. When the snow melts in summer, the mountain<b> slopes </b>are<b> carpeted </b>in flowers and plants. It’s a long ascent, though not too steep, and walkers generally take a <b>couple of days</b> to get to the summit (Q14) and return.","You’ll spend the night in our<b> hut </b>half-<b>way up</b> the mountain. That’s included in your package for the stay. It’s got cooking facilities, firewood and water for drinking (Q15). For washing, we recommend you use melted snow, though, to<b> conserve </b>supplies. We can take your luggage up on our snowmobile for you for just ten dollars a person. The<b> hut </b>has cooking<b> facilities </b>so you can make a hot meal in the evening and morning, but you <b>need to take</b> your own food.","The weather on <b>Mount Frenner</b> can be very stormy. In that case, stay in the<b> hut </b>– generally the storms don’t <b>last long</b> (Q16). Don’t stress about getting <b>back here</b> to the centre in time to catch the airport bus – they’ll probably not be running anyway. We <b>do have</b> an<b> emergency </b>locator<b> beacon </b>in the<b> hut </b>but <b>only use</b> that if it’s real emergency, like if someone’s ill or injured.","—————–","Now, <b>let me</b> <b>tell you something</b> about the different ski<b> trails </b>you can follow during your stay here.","Highland Trail’s directly accessible from where we are now. This trail’s been designed to give first-timers an experience they’ll enjoy regardless of their age or skill, but it’s also ideal for experts to practise their technique (Q17).","Then there’s Pine<b> Trail </b>… if you’re nervous about skiing, leave this one to the experts! You follow a<b> steep </b>valley looking <b>right down</b> on the river below – scary! But if you’ve fully mastered the techniques needed for hills, it’s great fun (Q18).","Stony Trail’s a <b>good choice</b> once you’ve got a general idea of the basics. There are <b>one or two</b> tricky sections, but <b>nothing too</b> challenging. There’s a shelter half-way where you can sit and take a break and enjoy the afternoon sunshine. (Q19)","And finally, Loser’s Trail. This starts off following a<b> gentle </b>river valley but the last part is quite exposed so the snow conditions can be challenging – if it’s snowing or windy, check with us before you set out to <b>make sure</b> the trail’s open that day. (Q20)","Right, so now if you’d like to follow me, we’ll <b>get started</b> …","#3 <b>Food packaging</b> labels Transcript","The Part 3 <b>audio transcript</b> of Labels showing information on nutrition in <b>food packaging</b> in Cambridge 13 <b>Listening Test</b> 4 is as follows:","JACK:     I’ve <b>still got</b> loads to do for our report on <b>nutritional food</b> labels.","ALICE:   <b>Me too</b>. What did you learn from doing the project about your own shopping habits?","JACK:     Well, I’ve always <b>had to check</b> labels for traces of<b> peanuts </b>in everything I eat because of my allergy. But beyond that I’ve never really been concerned enough to check how healthy a product is. (Q21)","ALICE:   This <b>project has</b> actually taught me to read the labels much more carefully. I tended to believe claims on packaging like ‘low in fat’. But I now realise that the ‘healthy’<b> yoghurt </b>I’ve bought for years is full of sugar and that it’s <b>actually quite</b> <b>high in calories</b>. (Q22)","JACK:     Ready meals are the worst … comparing the labels on supermarket pizzas was a real eye-opener. <b><b>Did you have</b> any</b> idea how many calories they contain? I was amazed.","ALICE:   Yes, <b>because unless</b> you read the label really carefully, you wouldn’t know that the<b> nutritional </b>values given are for half a pizza. (Q23)","JACK:     When <b>most people</b> eat the whole pizza. Not exactly transparent is it?","ALICE:   Not at all. But I expect it won’t stop you from buying pizza?","JACK:     Probably not, no! I thought comparing the different <b><b>labelling systems</b> used</b> by food manufactures was interesting. I think the kind of labelling system used makes a <b>big difference</b>.","ALICE:   Which one did you prefer?","JACK:     I liked the traditional daily value system best – the one which tells you what proportion of your required daily intake of each ingredient the product contains. I’m not sure it’s the easiest for <b>people to use</b> but at least you get the full story (Q24). I <b>like to know</b> all the ingredients in a product – not <b>just how much</b> fat, salt and sugar they contain.","ALICE:   But it’s good <b>supermarkets have</b> been making an effort to provide reliable information for customers.","JACK:     Yes. There <b>just need</b>s to be more consistency between <b><b>labelling systems</b> used</b> by different supermarkets, in terms of portion sizes, etc.","ALICE:   Mmm. The labels on the different brands of <b>chicken flavour</b><b> crisps </b>were quite<b> revealing </b>too, weren’t they?","JACK:     Yeah. I don’t understand how they can <b>get away</b> with calling them <b>chicken flavour</b> when they only contain artificial additives. (Q25)","ALICE:   I know. I’d at least <b>have expected</b> them to contain a small percentage of real chicken.","JACK:     Absolutely.","ALICE:   I <b>think having</b> <b>nutritional food</b> labeling has been a <b>good idea</b>, don’t you? I think it will change people’s behaviour and stop mothers, in particular, buying the wrong things.","JACK:     But didn’t that study kind of prove the opposite? People didn’t necessarily <b>stop buying</b> unhealthy products.","ALICE:   They only said that might be the case.  Those findings weren’t that conclusive (Q26) and it was quite a small-scale study. I think more <b>research has</b> to be done.","JACK:     Yes, I think you’re <b>probably right</b>.","——————–","JACK:     What <b>do you think</b> of the traffic-light system?","ALICE:   I think supermarkets like the <b>idea of having</b> a colour-coded system – red, orange or green – for levels of fat, sugar and salt in a product.","JACK:     Buy it’s not been adopted universally (Q27&28). And not on all products. Why do you suppose that is?","ALICE:   Pressure from the <b>food manufacturers</b>. Hardly surprising that some of them are<b> opposed </b>to flagging up how unhealthy their products are.","JACK:     I’d <b>have thought</b> it would have been compulsory. It seems<b> ridiculous </b>it isn’t.","ALICE:   I know. And what I couldn’t get over is the fact that it was brought in without enough consultation – a lot of experts had deep<b> reservations </b>about it.","JACK:     That is a bit weird. I suppose there’s an argument for doing the research now when consumers are familiar with this system.","ALICE:   Yeah, maybe.","JACK:     The participants in the survey were quite positive about the traffic-light system.","ALICE:   Mmm. But I don’t think they targeted the <b>right people</b>. They should <b>have focused</b> on people with low literacy levels because these labels are designed to be accessible to them.","JACK:     Yeah. But it’s <b>good to get</b> feedback from all socio-economic groups (Q29&30). And there wasn’t much variation in their responses.","ALICE:   No. But if they hadn’t interviewed participants face-to-face, they could <b>have used</b> a <b>much bigger</b> sample size. I wonder why they chose that method?","JACK:     Dunno. How were they selected? Did they volunteer or were they approached?","ALICE:   I think they volunteered. The thing that wasn’t stated was how often they bought packaged food – all we know is how frequently they used the supermarket.","#4 The <b>history of coffee</b> Transcript","The Part 4 <b>audio script</b> of The <b>history of coffee</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 4 is as follows:","In my presentation, I’m <b>going to talk</b> about coffee, and its importance both in <b>economic and social</b> terms. We think it was first drunk in the Arab world, but there’s <b>hardly any</b> documentary evidence of it before the 1500s, al<b>though of course</b> that doesn’t <b>mean that people</b> didn’t know about it before then.","However, there is evidence that coffee was originally gathered from bushes growing wild in Ethiopia, in the northeast of Africa. In the early sixteenth century, it was being bought by traders, and gradually its use as a drink spread throughout the <b>Middle East</b>. It’s <b>also known</b> that in 1522, in the Turkish city of Constantinople, which was the centre of the Ottoman Empire, the court<b> physician </b>approved its use as a medicine.","By the mid-1500s, coffee bushes were being cultivated in the Yemen and for the next <b>hundred years</b> this region produced most of the coffee drunk in Africa and the Arab world. What’s <b>particularly interesting</b> about coffee is its effect on<b> social </b>life. It was rarely drunk at home, but instead people went to <b>coffee houses</b> to drink it. These people, usually men, would meet to drink coffee and chat about issues of the day.","But at the time, this chance to share ideas and opinions was seen as something that was <b>potentially dangerous</b>, and in 1623 the ruler of Constantinople demanded the destruction of all the <b>coffee houses</b> in the city (Q31), although after his death many <b>new ones</b> opened, and <b>coffee consumption</b> continued.","In the <b>seventeenth century</b>, coffee drinking spread to Europe, and <b>here too</b> coffee shops became places where <b>ordinary people</b>, nearly always men, could meet to exchange ideas. Because of this, <b>some people</b> said that these places performed a similar function to universities (Q32). The opportunity they provided for people to <b>meet together</b> outside their <b><b>own home</b>s</b> and to discuss the topics of the day had an <b>enormous impact</b> on<b> social </b>life, and many<b> social </b>movements and political developments had their origins in coffee house discussions. (Q33)","——————–","In the late 1600s, the Yemeni<b> monopoly </b>on <b>coffee production</b> <b>broke down</b> and <b>coffee production</b> started to spread a<b>round the world</b>, helped by European colonization. Europeans <b>set up</b> coffee<b> plantations </b>in Indonesia and the Caribbean and production of coffee in the colonies skyrocketed. <b>Different types</b> of coffee were produced in <b>different areas</b>, and it’s interesting that the names given to these <b>different types</b>, like Mocha or Java coffee, were often taken from the port they were shipped to Europe from (Q34). But if you look at the<b> labour </b>system in the different colonies, there were some significant differences.","In Brazil and the various Caribbean colonies, <b>coffee was grown</b> in huge<b> plantations </b>and the workers there were <b>almost all</b> slaves (Q35). But this wasn’t the <b>same in all</b> colonies; for example in Java, which had been<b> colonized </b>by the Dutch, the<b> peasants </b>grew coffee and passed a proportion of this on to the Dutch, so it was used as a means of<b> taxation </b>(Q36).","But whatever system was used, under the European powers of the <b>eighteenth century</b>, <b>coffee production</b> was <b>very close</b>ly linked to colonisation. <b>Coffee was grown</b> in ever-increasing quantities to satisfy the growing demand from Europe, and it <b>became nearly</b> as important as sugar production (Q37), which was grown under <b>very similar</b> conditions. However, <b>coffee prices</b> were not yet low enough for people to drink it regularly at home, so most <b>coffee consumption</b> still <b>took place</b> in public <b>coffee houses</b> and it still remained something of a luxury item.","In Britain, however, a new drink was introduced from China, and started to become popular, gradually taking over from coffee, although at first it was so expensive that only the upper classes could afford it. This was tea, and by the late 1700s it was being widely drunk. However, when the USA gained independence from Britain in 1766, they identified this drink with Britain, and coffee remained the<b> preferred </b>drink in the USA (Q38), as it still is today.","So, by the early <b>nineteenth century</b>, coffee was already being widely produced and consumed. But during this century, production boomed and <b>coffee prices</b> started to fall. This was <b>partly because</b> new types of transportation had been developed which were cheaper and more efficient (Q39).","So now, working people could <b>afford to buy</b> coffee – it wasn’t <b>just a drink</b> for the <b>middle classes</b>. And this was at a time when large parts of Europe were starting to work in industries. And sometimes this meant their work didn’t stop when it got dark; they might have to continue throughout the night (Q40). So, the use of coffee as a<b> stimulant </b>became important – it wasn’t <b>just a drink</b> people<b> drank </b>in the morning, for breakfast.","There were also changes in<b> cultivation </b>…"]},{"name":"ALS/14-1","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Crime Report Form Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of <b><b>Crime Report</b> Form</b> <b><b>listening <b>answers in Listening</b></b> Test</b> 1 is as follows:","OFFICER:         <b>Good morning</b>.

My name’s Janet Parker and I’m the <b>human resources</b> manager. We’re <b>very happy</b> to welcome you to your <b>new apprentices</b>hip. I hope that the next <b>six months</b> will be a positive and <b>enjoyable experience</b> for you.","I’d <b>like to start</b> with <b>some general</b> advice about being an apprentice. Most of you have <b>very little</b> or <b>no experience</b> of working for a big organisation and the <b>first week</b> or so may be <b>quite challenging</b>. There will be a lot of new information to take in but don’t <b><b>worry too</b> much</b> about trying to remember everything. The <b>important thing</b> is to (Q11) check with someone if you’re not sure what to do – you’ll find your<b> supervisor </b>is very approachable and won’t mind <b>explaining things</b> or helping you out. You’re here to learn so <b>make the most</b> of that opportunity. You’ll be <b>spending time</b> in <b>different departments</b> during your <b>first week</b> so make an effort to (Q12) talk to as <b>many <b>people as possible</b></b> about their work – you’ll <b>make some</b> <b>new friends</b> and find out lots of useful information.","As <b>well as having</b> a supervisor, you’ll each be assigned a mentor. This person will be someone who’s recently completed an apprenticeship and you’ll meet with them on a weekly basis. Their <b>role is to provide</b> help and support throughout your apprenticeship. Of course, this doesn’t mean they’ll actually <b>do any</b> of your work for you – instead they’ll be asking you about (Q13) what goals you’ve achieved so far, as well as helping you to <b>identify any</b> areas for improvement. You can also (Q14) discuss your more long-term ambitions with them as well.","————————–","<b>Now I just</b> want to run through a few company policies for our apprenticeship scheme with you… <b>Most important</b>ly, the internet. As part of your job you’ll be <b>doing <b>some research</b></b> online so obviously you’ll have unlimited access for that but please (Q15) don’t use it for <b>personal use</b> – you’ll <b>have your own</b> phones for that.","<b>Some of you have</b> already asked me about <b>flexible working</b>. After your<b> probationary </b>three-month period – some of you will be eligible for this – but (Q16) it will depend on which department you’re in and what your <b>personal circumstances</b> are. So <b>please do</b>n’t assume you’ll automatically be<b> permitted </b>to do this.","<b>I </b> <b>want to make</b> sure there’s no confusion about our holiday policy. Apart from any<b> statutory </b>public holidays (Q17) we ask that you don’t book any holidays until after your six-month apprenticeship has finished. Time off should only be taken if you are unwell. Please speak to your<b> supervisor </b>if this is going to be a problem.","You’ll be expected to work a 40-hour week but there may be<b> opportunities </b>to <b>do overtime</b> during busy periods. Although you’re not required to do this, (Q18) it can be a <b>valuable experience</b> – so we advise you to <b>take it up</b> if possible. Obviously, we understand that <b>people do</b> have commitments outside work, so don’t worry if there are times when you are unavailable.","As you know, we don’t have a formal <b>dress code</b> here – you may wear casual clothes as long as they’re practical – and the only restriction for shoes we have is on <b>high heels</b> for <b><b>health and safety</b> reasons</b>.

You should <b>have done</b> most of the reading now, so I’d like you to share your ideas, and talk about the structure of your presentation and what you <b><b>need to do</b> next</b>.","CARLA:            OK Rob. I’m glad we chose quite a specific topic – <b>cities built</b> next to the sea. It made it <b>much easier</b> to find <b>relevant information</b>.","ROB:                Yeah. And cities are growing so quickly – I mean, we know that more than half the world’s <b>population lives</b> in cities now.","CARLA:            Yeah, though that’s all cities, not <b>just one</b>s on the coast. But (Q21) most of the biggest cities are actually <b>built by the sea</b>. I’d not realised that before.","ROB:                Nor me. And what’s more, a lot of them are built at places where rivers come out into the sea. But apparently this can be a problem.","CARLA:            Why?","ROB:                Well, as the city expands, agriculture and industry tend to spread <b>further inland</b> along the rivers, and so agriculture moves even <b>further inland</b> up the river. That’s not necessarily a problem, except (Q22) it means more and more<b> pollutants </b>are discharged into the rivers.","CARLA:            So these are brought downstream to the cities?","ROB:                Right. Hmm. <b>Did you read</b> that article about Miami, on the <b>east coast</b> of the USA?","CARLA:            No.","ROB:                Well, apparently back in the 1950s they build channels to drain away the water in case of flooding.","CARLA:            <b>Sounds sensible</b>.","ROB:                Yeah, they spent quite a <b>lot of money</b> on them. (Q23) But what they didn’t <b>take into account</b> was <b>global warming</b>. So they built the<b> drainage </b>channels <b>too close</b> to sea level, and now <b>sea levels</b> are rising, they’re more or less useless. If there’s a lot of rain, the water can’t run away, there’s nowhere for it to go. The <b>whole design</b> was faulty.","CARLA:            So what are the authorities doing about it now?","ROB:                I don’t know. I did read that they’re aiming to stop disposing of waste into the ocean over the <b>next <b>ten years</b></b>.","CARLA:            But that won’t help with flood prevention now, will it?","ROB:                No. Really (Q24) they just <b>need to find</b> the money for something to replace the<b> drainage </b>channels, in <b>order to protect</b> against flooding now. But in the <b>long term</b> they <b>need to consider</b> the whole ecosystem.","CARLA:            Right. Really, though, <b>coastal cities</b> can’t deal with their problems on their own, can they? I mean, they’ve got to start acting together at an international level <b>instead of just</b> doing their own thing.","ROB:                Absolutely. The thing is, <b>everyone knows</b> what the problems are and environmentalists have a <b>pretty good</b> idea of what we should be doing about them, so (Q25) they should be able to <b>work together</b> to <b>some extent</b>. But it’s going to be a <b>long time</b> before countries come to a decision on what<b> principles </b>they’re prepared to abide by.","CARLA:            Yes, if they ever do.","——————————","CARLA:            So I think we’ve <b>probably got</b> enough for our presentation. It’s only fifteen minutes.","ROB:                OK. So I suppose we’ll begin with <b>some general</b> historical background about why <b>coastal cities</b> were established. But (Q26) we don’t <b>want to spend</b> <b>too long</b> on that, the <b>other students</b> will <b>already know</b> a bit about it. It’s <b>all to do</b> with communications and so on.","CARLA:            Yes. We should mention some<b> geographical </b>factors, <b>things like</b><b> wetlands </b>and river<b> estuaries </b>and coastal erosion and so on. We could <b>have some</b> maps of different cities with these features marked.","ROB:                On a<b> handout </b>you mean? Or (Q27) <b>some slides</b> <b>everyone can see</b>?","CARLA:            Yeah, that’d be better.","ROB:                It’d be good to go into past mistakes in a bit more detail. <b>Did you read</b> that <b>case study</b> of the problems there were in New Orleans with flooding a <b><b>few years</b> ago</b>?","CARLA:            Yes, (Q28) We could use that as the basis for that part of the talk. I don’t think the <b>other students</b> will <b>have read</b> it, but they’ll remember hearing about the flooding at the time.","ROB:                OK. So that’s probably enough background.","CARLA:            So then we’ll go on to talk about what action’s being taken to deal with the problems of <b>coastal cities</b>.","ROB:                OK. What else <b>do we need</b> to talk about? <b>Maybe something</b> on future risks, looking more at the <b>long term</b>, if populations continue to grow.","CARLA:            Yeah. We’ll <b>need to do</b> a bit of work there, I haven’t got <b>much information</b>, have you?","ROB:                No. (Q29) We’ll <b>need to look</b> at <b>some websites</b>. Shouldn’t <b><b>take too</b> long</b>.","CARLA:            OK. And I think we should end by talking about international implications. Maybe (Q30) we could <b>ask people</b> in the audience. We’ve got people from <b>quite a lot</b> of <b>different places</b>.","ROB:                That’d be interesting, if we <b>have time</b>, yes. So now shall we …","#4 <b><b>Marine Renewable</b> Energy</b> Transcript","The Part 4 <b>audio script</b> of <b><b>Marine Renewable</b> Energy</b> (Ocean Energy) in <b>Listening Test</b> 1 is as follows:","<b>Producing enough</b> energy to meet our needs <b>has <b>become a serious</b></b> problem. Demand is rising rapidly, because of the world’s increasing population and expanding (Q31) industry. Burning<b> fossil </b>fuels, like gas, coal and oil, seriously damages the environment and they’ll eventually run out. For a <b>number of years</b> now, scientists <b>have been working</b> out how we can derive energy from<b> renewable </b>sources, such as the sun and wind, without causing pollution. Today I’ll outline <b><b>marine renewable</b> energy</b> – <b>also called</b> ocean energy – which harnesses the movement of the oceans.","<b><b>Marine renewable</b> energy</b> can be divided into <b>three main</b> categories: wave energy, <b>tidal energy</b> and <b>ocean <b>thermal energy</b></b> conversion, and I’ll say a <b>few words</b> about <b>each one</b>.","First, wave energy.<b> Numerous </b>devices have been invented to harvest wave energy, with names such as Wave Dragon, the Penguin and Mighty Whale, and <b>research is going</b> on to try and <b>come up</b> with a really <b>efficient method</b>. This form of energy <b>has plenty</b> of potential, as the source is (Q32) constant, and there’s <b>no danger</b> of waves coming to a standstill. But the problem with ocean waves is that they’re erratic, with the wind making them travel in every (Q33) direction. This adds to the difficulty of creating efficient technology: ideally all the waves would travel smoothly and regularly along the same<b> straight </b>line. Another drawback is that sand and other<b> sediment </b>on the ocean (Q34) floor might be stopped from flowing normally, which can lead to environmental problems.","——————————–","The second <b>category of marine</b> energy that I’ll mention is <b>tidal energy</b>. <b>One major</b> advantage of using the tide, rather than waves, as a <b>source of energy</b> is that it’s (Q35) predictable: we know the exact time of <b><b>high and low</b> tides</b> for <b>years to come</b>.","For <b>tidal energy</b> to be effective, the difference between <b><b>high and low</b> tides</b> needs to be at <b>least five</b> metres, and this occurs naturally in only about forty places on Earth.","One current plan is to create a tidal<b> lagoon </b>on the coast of Wales. This will be an <b>area of water</b> within a (Q36) bay at Swansea, sheltered by a U-shaped breakwater, or dam, built out from the coast. The<b> breakwater </b>will contain sixteen<b> hydro </b>turbines, and as the tide rises, water rushes through the breakwater, activating the turbines, which turn a generator to <b>produce electricity</b>. Then, for <b>three hours</b> as the tide goes out, the water is <b>held back</b> within the breakwater, increasing the difference in water level, until it’s several <b>metres high</b>er within the<b> lagoon </b>than in the open sea.","Then, in order to release the stored water, (Q37) gates in the<b> breakwater </b>are opened. It<b> pours </b>powerfully out of the lagoon, driving the<b> turbines </b>in the<b> breakwater </b>in the <b>opposite direction</b> and again generating thousands of<b> megawatts </b>of electricity. As there are two high tides a day, this<b> lagoon </b>scheme would generate electricity <b>four times</b> a day, <b>every day</b>, for a total of around 14 hours in every 24 – and enough electricity for over 150,000 homes.","This system has <b>quite a lot</b> in its favour: unlike solar and wind energy it doesn’t depend on the weather; the<b> turbines </b>are operated without the need for (Q38) fuel, so it doesn’t create any <b>greenhouse gas</b> emissions; and <b>very little</b><b> maintenance </b>is needed. It’s<b> estimated </b>that electricity generated in this way will be relatively cheap, and that manufacturing the components would create than 2,000 (Q39) jobs, a big boost to the local economy.","On the other hand, there are fears that<b> lagoons </b>might harm both fish and birds, for example by disturbing (Q40) migration patterns, and causing a build-up of silt, affecting local ecosystems.","There are <b>other forms</b> of <b>tidal energy</b>, but I’ll go on to the third <b>category of marine</b> energy: <b>ocean <b>thermal energy</b></b> conversion. This depends on there being a <b>big difference</b> in<b> temperature </b>between surface water and the water a couple of kilo<b>metres below the surface</b>, and this occurs in tropical coastal areas. The idea is to bring <b>cold water</b> <b><b>up to the surface</b> using</b> a<b> submerged </b>pipe. The concept <b>dates back</b> to 1881, when …"]},{"name":"ALS/14-2","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Total Health Clinic Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of <b>Total <b>Health Clinic</b></b> <b><b>listening <b>answers in Listening</b></b> Test</b> 2 is as follows:","CARL:               Hi, come and take a seat.","JULIE:               Thank you.","CARL:               My name’s Carl Rogers and I’m one of the doctors here at the <b>Total <b>Health Clinic</b></b>.

The first building was a fort constructed in 914 AD for defence against Danish invaders by King Alfred the Great’s daughter, who ruled England at the time. In the following century, after the Normans<b> conquered </b>England, the land was given to a nobleman called Richard de Vere, and he built a<b> castle </b>there that stayed in the de Vere family for over <b>four <b>hundred years</b></b>.","However, when Queen Elizabeth I announced that she was going to visit the<b> castle </b>in 1576 it was beginning to look a bit run down, and it was decided that rather than repair the guest rooms, (Q11) they’d make a new house for her out of wood next to the <b>main hall</b>. She stayed there for four nights and apparently it was very luxurious, but unfortunately it was destroyed a few <b>years later</b> by fire.","In the <b>seventeenth century</b> the<b> castle </b>belonged to the wealthy Fenys family, who enlarged it and made it more comfortable. However, by 1982 the Fenys family could <b>no longer</b> afford to maintain the castle, <b>even though</b> they received government support, and they put it on the market. It was eventually taken over by (Q12) a company who owned a number of amusement parks, but when we get there I think you’ll see that they’ve managed to <b>retain the original</b> atmosphere of the castle.","When you go inside, you’ll find that in the state rooms (Q13) there are life-like moving wax models dressed in costumes of different periods in the past, which even carry on conversations together. As well as that, in every room there are booklets giving information about what the room was used for and the history of the objects and furniture it contains.","The<b> castle </b>park’s <b>quite extensive</b>. At <b>one time</b> sheep were kept there, and in the <b>nineteenth century</b> the owners had a little zoo with <b>animals like</b> rabbits and even a baby elephant. Nowadays the old zoo buildings are used for (Q14) public displays of painting and sculpture. The park <b>also has</b> some beautiful trees, though the oldest of all, which dated back 800 years, was sadly blown down in 1987.","Now, you’re free to wander around on your own until 4.30, but then at the end of our visit we’ll all <b>meet together</b> at the bottom of the Great Staircase. We’ll then go on to the long gallery, where there’s a wonderful collection of<b> photographs </b>showing the family who owned the<b> castle </b>a <b><b>hundred years</b> ago</b> having tea and cakes in the<b> conservatory </b>– and we’ll then take you to (Q15) the same place, where afternoon tea will be served to you.","——————————-","Now if you can <b>take a look</b> at your plans you’ll see <b>Branley Castle</b> has four towers, joined together by a high wall, with the river on <b>two sides</b>.","Don’t miss seeing the Great Hall. That’s near the river in the main tower, the biggest one, which was extended and<b> redesigned </b>in the <b>eighteenth century</b>.","If you want to <b>get a good</b> view of the whole castle, you can walk around the walls. (Q16) The <b>starting point</b>’s <b>quite near</b> the <b>main entrance</b> – walk<b> straight </b><b>down the path</b> <b>until you get</b> to the <b>south gate</b>, and it’s just there. Don’t go on to the north gate – there’s <b>no way</b> up from there.","There’ll shortly be a show in which you can see archers displaying their skill with a bow and arrow. The quickest <b>way to get</b> there is to (Q17) <b>take the <b>first <b>left after the main</b></b></b> entrance and follow the path past the bridge, then you’ll see it in front of you at the end.","If you like animals there’s also a display of<b> hunting </b>birds – falcons and eagles and so on. If you (Q18) go from the <b>main entrance</b> in the direction of the <b>south gate</b>, but <b>turn right</b> before you get there <b>instead of going</b> through it, you’ll see it on your right past the first tower.","At 3 pm there’s a short performance of traditional dancing on the (Q19) outdoor stage. That’s right at the <b>other side</b> of the<b> castle </b>from the entrance, and over the bridge. It’s about <b>ten minutes</b>’ walk or so.","And finally the shop. It’s actually (Q20) inside one of the towers, but the way in is from the outside. Just <b>take the <b>first <b>left after the main</b></b></b> entrance, go <b>down the path</b> and <b>take the first</b> right. It’s <b>got some</b> lovely gifts and souvenirs.","Right, so we’re just arriving …","#3 <b>Wolly Mammoths</b> Transcript","The Part 3 <b>audio transcript</b> of <b>Wolly Mammoths</b> on St Paul island in Cambridge 14 <b>Listening Test</b> 2 is as follows:","TUTOR:            So, Rosie and Martin, let’s look at what you’ve got for your presentation on <b><b>woolly mammoth</b>s</b>.","ROSIE:             OK, we’ve got a short outline here.","TUTOR:            Thanks. So it’s about a <b>research project</b> in <b>North America</b>?","MARTIN:         Yes. But we thought we needed something general about <b><b>woolly mammoth</b>s</b> in our introduction, to establish that they were related to our modern elephant, and they lived <b>thousands of years</b> ago in the <b><b>last ice</b> age</b>.","ROSIE:             Maybe we could show a <b>video clip</b> of a cartoon about mammoths. But that’d be a bit childish. Or we could have a diagram, (Q21) it could be a timeline to show when they lived, with illustrations?","MARTIN:         Or we could just show a drawing of them walking in the ice? No, let’s go with your last suggestion.","TUTOR:            Good. Then you’re describing the <b><b>discovery of the mammoth</b> tooth</b> on St Paul’s Island in Alaska, and why it was significant.","ROSIE:             Yes. The tooth was found by a man called Russell Graham. He picked it up from under a rock in a cave. He knew it was special – for a start it was in <b>really good</b> condition, as if it had been just extracted from the animal’s jawbone. Anyway, they found it was 6,500 <b>years old</b>.","TUTOR:            So why was that significant?","ROSIE:             Well (Q22) the<b> mammoth </b>bones previously found on the <b>North America</b>n mainland were <b>much less</b> recent than that. So this was really amazing.","MARTIN:         Then we’re making an animated diagram to show the<b> geography </b>of the area in <b>prehistoric times</b>. So originally, St Paul’s Island wasn’t an island, it was connected to the mainland, and<b> mammoths </b>and <b>other animals</b> like <b>bears were able</b> to<b> roam </b>around the <b>whole area</b>.","ROSIE:             Then the climate warmed up and the sea <b>level b</b>egan to rise, and the island got cut off from the mainland. So (Q23) those<b> mammoths </b>on the island couldn’t escape; they had to stay on the island.","MARTIN:         And in fact the<b> species </b>survived there for <b>thousands of years</b> after they’d <b>become extinct</b> on the mainland.","TUTOR:            So why <b>do you think</b> they died out on the mainland?","ROSIE:             <b>No one</b>’s sure.","MARTIN:         Anyway, next we’ll explain how Graham and his team identified the date when the<b> mammoths </b>became extinct on the island. They concluded that (Q24) the extinction happened 5,600 <b>years ago</b>, which is a very precise time for a<b> prehistoric </b>extinction. It’s based on samples they took from mud at the bottom of a lake on the island. They analysed it to find out what had fallen in over time – bits of plants, <b>volcanic ash</b> and even DNA from the<b> mammoths </b>themselves. It’s standard procedure, but it took <b>nearly two</b> years to do.","————————-","TUTOR:            So why don’t you quickly <b>go through the main</b> sections of your presentation and discuss what action’s needed for each part?","MARTIN:         OK. So for the introduction, we’re using a visual, so once we’ve prepared that we’re done.","ROSIE:             I’m not sure. I think (Q25) we <b>need to write</b> down all the ideas we <b>want to include</b> here, not just rely on memory. How we begin the presentation is so important …","MARTIN:         You’re right.","ROSIE:             The <b><b>discovery of the mammoth</b> tooth</b> is <b>probably the most</b> dramatic part, but we don’t have that <b>much information</b>, only what we got from the online article. I thought maybe (Q26) we could <b>get in touch</b> with the researcher who led the team and <b>ask him</b> to tell us a bit more.","MARTIN:          Great idea. What about the section with the initial questions asked by the researchers? We’ve <b>got a lot</b> on that but we <b>need to make</b> it interesting.","ROSIE:             We could (Q27) ask the audience to suggest <b>some questions</b> about it and then <b>see how many</b> of them we can answer.

Most ancient cultures had weather gods, and weather catastrophes, such as floods, <b><b>played an important</b> role</b> in many creation myths.","For instance, there’s the Egyptian <b>sun god</b> Ra, and Thor, the Norse god of<b> thunder </b>and lightning. Many <b>ancient civilisations</b> developed<b> rites </b>such as (Q31) dances in <b>order to make</b> the weather gods look kindly on them.","But the weather was of daily importance: observing the skies and drawing the correct conclusions from these observations was <b>really important</b>, in fact their (Q32) survival depended on it. It isn’t known when people first started to observe the skies, but at around 650 BC, the Babylonians produced the first short-range weather forecasts, based on their observations of (Q33) clouds and other phenomena. The Chinese also recognised weather patterns, and by 300 BC, astronomers had developed a calendar which divided the year into 24 (Q34) festivals, each associated with a <b>different weather</b> phenomenon.","The <b><b>ancient Greek</b>s</b> were the first to develop a more scientific approach to explaining the weather. The work of the<b> philosopher </b>and scientist Aristotle, in the fourth century BC, is especially noteworthy, as his ideas held<b> sway </b>for nearly 2,000 years. In 340 BC, he wrote a book in which he attempted to account for the formation of rain, clouds, wind and storms.","He also described<b> celestial </b>phenomena such as<b> haloes </b>– that is, bright circles of light around the sun, the moon and bright stars – and (Q35) comets. Many of his observations were surprisingly accurate. For example, he believed that heat could cause water to evaporate. Errors like this were<b> rectified </b>from the Renaissance onwards.","———————–","For nearly 2,000 years, Aristotle’s work was accepted as the chief authority on weather theory. Alongside this, though, in the <b>Middle Ages</b> weather observations were passed on in the form of proverbs, such as ‘Red (Q36) sky at night, shepherd’s delight; red sky in the morning, shepherd’s warning’. Many of these are based on <b>very good</b> observations and are accurate, as contemporary<b> meteorologists </b><b>have discovered</b>.","For centuries, any attempt to forecast the weather could only be based on personal observation, but in the fifteenth century scientists began to see the need for (Q37) instruments. Until then, the <b><b>only one</b>s</b> available were weather<b> vanes </b>– to determine the wind direction – and early versions of rain gauges. <b>One of the first</b>, invented in the fifteenth century, was a hygrometer, which measured humidity. This was one of many inventions that contributed to the development of <b>weather forecasting</b>.","In 1592, the Italian scientist and inventor Galileo developed the world’s first (Q38) thermometer. His student Torricelli later invented the barometer, which <b>allowed people</b> to measure<b> atmospheric </b>pressure. In 1648, the French<b> philosopher </b>Pascal proved that pressure decreases with altitude. This discovery was verified by English astronomer Halley in 1686, and Halley was also the <b>first person</b> to map <b>trade winds</b>.","This increasing ability to measure factors related to weather helped scientists to understand the atmosphere and its processes better, and they started collecting weather observation data systematically. In the <b>eighteenth century</b>, the scientist and<b> politician </b>Benjamin Franklin carried out work on electricity and lightning in particular, but he was also <b>very interested</b> in weather and studied it throughout most of his life. It was Franklin who discovered that (Q39) storms generally travel from west to east.","In addition to new<b> meteorological </b>instruments, <b>other developments</b> contributed to our understanding of the atmosphere. People in <b>different locations</b> began to keep records, and in the mid-<b>nineteenth century</b>, the invention of the (Q40) telegraph <b>made it possible</b> for these records to be collated. This led, by the <b>end of the nineteenth</b> century, to the first weather services.","It was not until the early <b>twentieth century</b> that<b> mathematics </b>and<b> physics </b><b>became part</b> of meteorology, and we’ll continue from that point <b>next week</b>."]},{"name":"ALS/14-3","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Flanders conference hotel Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of <b><b>Flanders conference</b> hotel</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 3 is as follows:","ANGELA:         Hello, <b><b>Flanders conference</b> hotel</b>.","MAN:               Oh, hi.

My name’s Lucy Crittenden, and I’m the Director of Operations for an organisation that arranges volunteering in this part of the country. I’m<b> hoping </b>I can persuade <b>one or two</b> of you to become volunteers yourselves. <b>Let me</b> start by briefly explaining what we mean by volunteering.","Volunteers are teenagers and adults who choose to <b>spend some</b> time, unpaid, <b>helping other</b> people in <b>some way</b>. <b>Most volunteers</b><b> devote </b><b>two or three</b> hours to this every week, <b>while a few</b> do much more. The people they help may <b>have physical</b> or behavioural difficulties, for example.","Volunteers can do <b>all sorts</b> of things, depending on their own abilities and interests. If they’re supporting a family that’s struggling, for example, they may be <b>able to give</b> them tips on cooking or recommend how to plan their budget or how to shop<b> sensibly </b>on their income. They might <b>even do</b> (Q11) <b>some painting</b> or wallpapering, perhaps alongside any <b>members of the family</b> who are <b>able to do</b> it. Or <b>even do</b> (Q12) some babysitting so that parents can go out for a while.","The benefit from volunteering isn’t only for the people being helped. Volunteers <b>also gain</b> from it: they’re <b>using their skills</b> to cope with somebody’s mental or physical ill health, and (Q13) volunteering may be a valuable element of their CV when they’re applying for jobs: employers usually look favourably on someone who’s <b>given up</b> <b>time to help</b> others. Significantly, <b>most volunteers</b> (Q14) feel that what they’re doing gives them a purpose in their lives. And in my opinion, they’re lucky in that respect, as <b>many people</b> don’t have that feeling.","——————–","Now I’d <b>like to tell</b> you what some of our volunteers <b>have said</b> about what they do, to <b>give you an idea</b> of the range of ways in which they can <b>help people</b>.","Habib supports an elderly lady who’s <b>beginning to show</b> signs of dementia. <b>Once a week</b> they, along with other elderly people, go to the local <b>community centre</b>, where a <b>group of people</b> come in and sing. The songs (Q15) take the listeners back to their youth, and for a little while they can forget the difficulties that they face now.","Our volunteer Consuela is an amazing woman. (Q16) She <b>has difficulty</b> walking herself, but she doesn’t let that stop her. She helps a <b>couple of people</b> with similar difficulties, who had almost stopped walking altogether. By using herself as an example, Consuela encourages them to walk more and more.","Minh visits a <b>young man</b> who lives alone and can’t leave his home on his own, so he <b>hardly ever</b> saw anyone. But together (Q17) they go out to the cinema, or to see friends the <b>young man</b> hadn’t been able to visit for a <b>long time</b>.","Tanya visits an elderly woman <b>once a week</b>. When the woman found out that Tanya is a professional dressmaker, she <b>got interested</b>. Tanya showed her some soft toys she’d made, and (Q18) the woman <b>decided to try</b> it herself. And now she really enjoys it, and spends hours <b>making toys</b>. They’re not perhaps up to Tanya’s standard yet, but she gains a lot of pleasure from doing it.","Alexei is a volunteer with a family that faces a number of difficulties. By calmly talking over possible solutions with <b>family member</b>s, he’s helping them to realise that they aren’t helpless, and that (Q19) they can <b><b>do some</b>thing</b> themselves to improve their situation. This has been great for their self-esteem.","And the last volunteer I’ll mention, though there are plenty more, is Juba. She volunteers with a teenage girl with learning difficulties, who wasn’t <b>very good</b> at talking to <b>other people</b>. Juba’s worked very patiently with her, (Q20) and now the girl is <b>far better</b> at expressing herself, and at understanding <b>other people</b>.","OK, I hope that’s given you an idea of what volunteering is all about. Now I’d like …","#3 <b><b>School Marching</b> Band</b> Transcript","The Part 3 <b>audio transcript</b> of <b><b>School Marching</b> Band</b> in Cambridge 14 <b>Listening Test</b> 3 is as follows:","LIZZIE:            So how are you getting on with your teaching practice at the <b>High School</b>, Joe?","JOE:                 Well I’ve been <b>put in charge</b> of the <b><b>school marching</b> band</b>, and it’s quite a responsibility.

Well the <b>band has</b> students in it from <b>all year</b>s, so they’re aged 11 to 18, and there are about (Q21) 50 of them altogether. It’s quite a popular activity within the school. I’ve never worked with a band of more than 20 before, and this is <b>very different</b>.","LIZZIE:              I can imagine.","JOE:                 They aren’t really <b>good enough</b> to enter national band competitions, but they’re in a (Q22) regional one later in the term. Even if they don’t win, and I don’t expect them to, hopefully it’ll be an incentive for them to <b>try and improve</b>.","LIZZIE:             Yes, hopefully.","JOE:                 Well, now the <b>town council</b>’s organising a (Q23)<b> carnival </b>in the summer, and the <b>band has</b> been asked to perform. If you ask me, they aren’t <b>really up</b> to it yet, and I <b>need to get</b> them functioning better as a band, and in a very <b>short time</b>.","LIZZIE:             Have you been <b>doing anything</b> with them? Apart from practising the music, I mean.","JOE:                 I played a recording I <b>came across</b>, of a (Q24) drummer talking about how playing in a <b>band had</b> changed his life. I think it was an after-dinner speech. I thought it was pretty inspiring, because being in the <b>band had</b> stopped him from getting involved in crime. The students seemed to find it interesting, too.","LIZZIE:             That’s good.","JOE:                 I’m planning to show them that old (Q25) film from the 1940s ‘Strike Up the Band’, and talk about it with the students. What <b>do you think</b>?","LIZZIE:             <b>Good idea</b>. As it’s about a school band, it might make the students realise how much they can achieve if they <b>work together</b>.","JOE:                 That’s what I’ve got in mind. I’m<b> hoping </b>I can <b>take some</b> of the band to a (Q26)<b> parade </b>that’s <b>going to take</b> place <b>next month</b>.

I’m sure you’ll <b>have <b><b>some idea</b>s</b></b> about what I can do.","LIZZIE:             <b>Go ahead</b>.","JOE:                 There’s a<b> flautist </b>who says she loves playing in the band. We<b> rehearse </b><b>twice a week</b> after school, but (Q27) she’s <b>hardly ever</b> there. Then she looks for me the next day and gives me a very plausible reason – she says she had to help her mother, or she’s been ill, but to be honest, I don’t believe her.","LIZZIE:             <b>Oh dear</b>! Any more students with difficulties?","JOE:                 Plenty! There’s a<b> trumpeter </b>who thinks she’s the best<b> musician </b>in the band, though she certainly isn’t. (Q28) She’s always saying what she thinks <b>other people</b> should do, which makes my job pretty difficult.","LIZZIE:             She sounds a bit of a nightmare!","JOE:                 You can say that again. One of the<b> trombonists </b>has got an<b> impressive </b>sense of rhythm, and could be an<b> excellent </b>musician – except that (Q29) he has breathing difficulties, and he doesn’t really <b>have enough</b><b> breath </b>for the trombone. He’d be <b>much better</b> of playing percussion, for instance, but he <b>refuses to give</b> up. So he ends up only playing half the notes.","LIZZIE:             I suppose you have to admire his determination.","JOE:                 Maybe. One of the<b> percussionists </b>isn’t <b>too bad</b>, but (Q30) he never seems to interact with <b>other people</b>, and he always rushes off as soon as the<b> rehearsal </b>ends.

These will be public performances, and the <b>programme has</b> just been finalised. The theme of the festival is links between the UK and Australia, and this is reflected in the music: each concert will feature both British and <b>Australian composers</b>. I’ll tell you briefly about the Australian music, as you probably won’t be familiar with that.","The first concert will include music by Liza Lim, who was born in Perth, Western Australia, in 1966. As a child, Lim originally <b>learned to play</b> the piano – like so <b>many children</b> – and also the (Q31) violin. She found this was her real strength, and she studied and later taught composition, both in Australia and in <b>other countries</b>. As a composer, she has received<b> commissions </b>from<b> numerous </b>orchestras, other performers and festivals in <b>several countries</b>.","Liza Lim’s<b> compositions </b>are vibrant and full of (Q32) energy, and she often<b> explores </b>Asian and Australian Aboriginal cultural sources, including the native instrument, the didgeridoo: this is featured in a work called The Compass. Her music is very expressive, so although it is (Q33) complex, it <b>has the power</b> of connecting with audiences and performers alike.","In the festival we’re going to give a semi-staged performance of The Oresteia. This is an (Q34) opera in seven parts, based on the<b> trilogy </b>of <b>ancient Greek</b> tragedies by Aeschylus. Lim composed this when she was in her mid-20s, and she also wrote the text, along with Barrie Kosky. It’s performed by six singers, a dancer, and an<b> orchestra </b>that, as well as standard<b> orchestral </b>instruments, includes electric guitar, and a traditional Turkish<b> stringed </b>instrument. Lim wrote that because the stories in the tragedies are not easy to tell, the sounds she creates are also (Q35) disturbing, and they include breathing, sobbing, laughing and whistling. The work lasts around 75 minutes, and the rest of the concert will consist of<b> orchestral </b>works by the <b>British composers</b> Ralph Vaughan Williams and Frederick Delius.","——————————-","Moving on now to our second concert, this will begin with instrumental music by <b>British composers</b> – Benjamin Britten and Judith Weir. After the interval we’ll go to Australia for a piece by Ross Edwards: The <b>Tower of Remoteness</b>. According to Edwards, the<b> inspiration </b>for this piece came from nature, when he was sitting alone in the dry bed of a creek,<b> overshadowed </b>by the leaves of <b>palm trees</b>, listening to the <b>birds and insects</b>. The <b>Tower of Remoteness</b> is scored for piano and (Q36) clarinet. Edwards says he realised years after writing the piece that he had<b> subconsciously </b>modelled its opening phrase on a bird call.","Ross Edwards was born in 1943 in Sydney, Australia, and studied at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music and the universities of Adelaide and Sydney. He’s <b>well known</b> in Australia, and in fact he’s one of the country’s most performed composers. He’s written a <b>wide range</b> of music, from<b> symphonies </b>and<b> concertos </b>to some composed specifically for children. Edward’s <b>music has</b> been described as being ‘deeply connected to Australia’, and it can be regarded as a celebration of the (Q37) diversity of cultures that Australia can be proud of.","The last of the three <b>Australian composers</b> to be represented in our festival is Carl Vine. Born in 1954, Vine, like Liza Lim, comes from Perth, Western Australia. He <b>took up</b> the<b> cornet </b>at the age of five, switching to the piano <b>five <b>years later</b></b>. However, he went to university to study (Q38) physics, before changing to composition. After graduating he moved to Sydney and worked as a freelance<b> pianist </b>and composer. Before long he <b>had become</b> prominent in Australia as a<b> composer </b>for (Q39) dance, and in fact has written 25 scores of that type.","In our third concert, Vine will be represented by his music for the flag hand-over ceremony of the (Q40) Olympics held in 1996."]},{"name":"ALS/14-4","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Enquiry about booking hotel room Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of <b><b><b>Enquiry about booking</b> hotel</b> room</b> for an event in <b>Listening Test</b> 4 is as follows:","ANDREW:        <b>Good morning</b>, Clare House Hotel.

And they’re also your (Q6) support – if anything goes wrong, the MC will deal with it, so you can relax.","SAM:               Great! I’ll need to ask you about food, but something else that’s important is accommodation. You obviously have rooms in the hotel, but do you <b>also have</b> <b>any other</b> accommodation, like (Q7) cabins, for example?","ANDREW:        Yes, there are five in the grounds, all self-contained. They each <b>sleep two</b> to <b>four people</b> and <b>have their own</b> <b>living room</b>, bathroom and small kitchen.","SAM:               That <b>sounds perfect</b> for what we’ll need.","——————————","SAM:               Now you have various facilities, don’t you? Are they all <b>included in the price</b> of hiring the room? The pool, for instance.","ANDREW:        Normally you’d be <b>able to use</b> it, but (Q8) it’ll be closed throughout September for refurbishment, I’m afraid. (Q9) The gym will be available, though, at <b>no <b>extra charge</b></b>. That’s <b>open all</b> day, from six in the <b>morning until</b> midnight.","SAM:               Right.","ANDREW:        And the <b>tennis courts</b>, but (Q10) there is a small <b>additional payment</b> for those. We have four courts, and it’s worth booking in advance if you possibly can, as there can be <b>quite a long</b> <b>waiting list</b> for them!","SAM:               Right.

I’m Jake Stevens and I’m your rep here at the hotel. I’m sure you’ll all <b>have a great</b> time here. So <b>let <b>me <b>tell you a bit</b></b></b> about what’s on offer. I’ll start by <b>telling you about some</b> of the<b> excursions </b>that are available for guests.","<b>One thing</b> you <b>have to do</b> while you’re here is go dolphin watching. On our boat trips, we <b>pretty well</b><b> guarantee </b>you’ll <b>see dolphins</b> – if you don’t you can repeat the trip <b>free of charge</b>. We organise daily trips for just 35 euros. Unfortunately (Q11) there aren’t any places left for this afternoon’s trip, but <b>come and see</b> me to book for later in the week.","If you’re energetic, I’d recommend our forest walk. It’s a guided walk of about seven kilometres. There’ll be a stop half way, and (Q11) you’ll be provided with a drink and sandwiches. There’s some fairly<b> steep </b><b>climbs up</b> the hills, so you need to be reasonably fit for this one, with good shoes, and bring a<b> waterproof </b>in case it rains. It’s just 25<b> euros </b>all inclusive, and it’s every Wednesday.","Then on Thursdays we organise a cycle trip, which will give you all the fun of biking without the effort. We’ll take you and your bike up to the top of Mount Larna, and leave you to bike back – (Q13) it’s a 700-metre drop in just 20 kilometres so this isn’t really for<b> inexperienced </b>cyclists as you’ll be going <b>pretty fast</b>. And if it’s a clear day, you’ll <b>have fantastic</b> views.","On our local<b> craft </b>tour you can find out about the traditional activities in the island. And the <b>best thing</b> about this trip is that (Q14) it’s <b>completely free</b>. You’ll be taken to a factory where<b> jewellery </b>is made, and also a<b> ceramics </b>centre. If you want, you can buy some of the products but that’s <b>entirely up</b> to you. The trip starts after lunch on Thursday, and you’ll return by 6 pm.","If you’re interested in astronomy you may <b>already know</b> that the island’s <b>one of the best</b> <b>places in the world</b> to observe the night sky. We can offer trips to the<b> observatory </b>on Friday for those who are interested. They cost 90<b> euros </b><b>per person</b> and you’ll be shown the huge telescopes and have a talk from an expert, who’ll explain all about how they work. (Q15) Afterwards we’ll head down to Sunset Beach, where you can have a dip in the ocean if you want before we head off back to the hotel.","Finally, there’s <b>horse riding</b>. This is organised by the Equestrian Centre over near Playa Cortino and it’s a great experience if you’re a keen horseback rider, (Q16) or even if you’ve never been on a horse before. They take you down to the beach, and you can<b> canter </b>along the sand and through the waves. It costs 35<b> euros </b>and it’s available <b>every day</b>.","———————————-","So there’s plenty to do in the daytime, but what about night life?","Well, the <b>number one</b> attraction’s called ‘Musical Favourites’. Guests enjoy a three-course meal and unlimited free drinks, and watch a fantastic show, starting with musicals set in Paris and then crossing the Atlantic to <b>Las Vegas</b> and finally Copacabana. At the end the (Q17) cast members come down from the stage, still in their<b> stunning </b>costumes, and you’ll <b>have a chance</b> to chat with them. It’s hugely popular, so <b>let <b>me know</b></b> now if you’re interested because (Q18) it’s <b>no good</b> leaving it <b>until the last</b> minute. It’s on Friday night. Tickets are just 50<b> euros </b>each, but for an extra 10<b> euros </b>you can have a table right by the stage.","If you’d <b>like to go</b> <b>back in time</b>, there’s the<b> Castle </b>Feast on <b>Saturday evening</b>. It’s held in a twelfth-century castle, and you eat in the great courtyard, with ladies in long<b> gowns </b>serving your food. You’re given a whole chicken each, which you eat in the<b> medieval </b>way, (Q19) using your hands instead of cutlery, and you’re entertained by competitions where the horseback riders attempt to knock <b>one another</b> off their horses. Then you can watch the dancers in the ballroom and (Q20) join in as <b>well if you want</b>. OK, so now if anyone…","#3 Part 3 Transcript","The Part 3 <b>audio transcript</b> of in Cambridge 14 <b>Listening Test</b> 4 is as follows:","STEPHANIE:     Hello, Trevor.","TREVOR:          Hello, Stephanie. You said you wanted to talk about the course I’m taking on literature for children.","STEPHANIE:     That’s right. I’m <b>thinking of doing</b> it <b>next year</b>, but I’d <b>like to find</b> out more about it first.","TREVOR:          OK, well, as you probably know, it’s a one-year course. It’s divided into six modules, and you <b>have to take</b> all of them. <b>One of the most</b> interesting ones, for me, at least, was about the purpose of children’s literature.","STEPHANIE:     You mean, whether it should just entertain children or should be educational, as well.","TREVOR:          Right, and whether the teaching should be<b> factual </b>– giving them information about the world – or ethical, teaching them values. What’s fascinating is that (Q21) the writer isn’t necessarily<b> conscious </b>of the message they’re conveying. For instance, a story might show a child who has a problem as a result of not doing what an adult has told them to do, implying that children should always obey adults.","STEPHANIE:     I <b>see what you mean</b>.","TREVOR:          That module <b>made me</b> realise how important stories are – they can have a <b>significant effect</b> on children as they <b>grow up</b>. Actually, (Q22) it inspired me to <b>have a go</b> at it myself, just for my own interest. I know can’t compete with the really popular stories, like the Harry Potter books – they’re <b>very good</b>, and even young kids like my seven-year-old niece love reading them.","STEPHANIE:     Mm. I’m <b>very interested</b> in illustrations in stories. Is that covered in the course?","TREVOR:          Yes, there’s a module on pictures, and how they’re sometimes <b>central to the story</b>.","STEPHANIE:     That’s good. I remember some<b> frightening </b>ones I saw as a child and I can <b>still see</b> them vividly in my mind, <b>years later</b>! Pictures can be so powerful, just as powerful as words. I’ve always enjoyed drawing, so (Q23) that’s the field I <b>want to go</b> into when I finish the course. I bet that module will be <b>really helpful</b>.","TREVOR:          I’m sure it will. We also studied comics in that module, but I’m not convinced of their value, not compared with books. <b><b>One of the great</b> things</b> about words is that you use your imagination, but with a comic you don’t have to.","STEPHANIE:     There are plenty of kids who wouldn’t even try to read a book, so I think (Q24) comics can serve a <b>really useful</b> purpose.","TREVOR:          You mean, it’s better to read a comic than not to read at all? Yes, I suppose you’re right. I just think its sad when children don’t read books.","STEPHANIE:     What about books for girls and books for boys? Does the course go into that?","TREVOR:          Yes, there’s a module on it. For years, lots of stories, in English, at least, assumed that boys went out and did adventurous things and girls stayed at home and <b>played with dolls</b>. I was amazed (Q25) how many books were targeted at <b>just one</b> sex or the other. Of course this reflects society as it is when the books are written.","STEPHANIE:     That’s true. So it <b>sounds as though</b> you think it’s a good course.","TREVOR:          Definitely.","———————————-","TREVOR:          Have you been reading lots of children’s stories, to <b><b>help you decide</b> whether</b> to take the course?","STEPHANIE:     Yeah. I’ve gone as <b>far back</b> as the late <b>seventeenth century</b>, though I know there were earlier children’s stories.","TREVOR:          So <b>does that mean</b> you’ve read Perrault’s <b>fairy tales</b>? Cinderella, The Sleeping Beauty, and so on.","STEPHANIE:     Yes. They must be important, (Q26) because no stories of that type had been written before, there were the first. Then there’s The <b>Swiss Family</b> Robinson.","TREVOR:          I haven’t read that.","STEPHANIE:     The English name makes it sound as though Robinson is the family’s surname, but a more accurate translation would be The Swiss Robinsons, because it’s about (Q27) a <b>Swiss family</b> who are shipwrecked, like Robinson Crusoe in the novel of a century earlier.","TREVOR:          Well I <b>never knew</b> that!","STEPHANIE:     <b>Have you read</b> Hoffmann’s The Nutcracker and the Mouse King?","TREVOR:          Wasn’t that (Q28) the basis for Tchaikovsky’s ballet The Nutcracker?","STEPHANIE:     That’s right. It <b>has some</b> quite<b> bizarre </b>elements.","TREVOR:          I hope you’ve read Oscar Wilde’s The <b>Happy Prince</b>. It’s probably my favourite children’s story of <b>all time</b>.","STEPHANIE:     <b>Mine too</b>! And it’s so surprising, because Wilde is <b>best known</b> for his plays, and most of them are very witty, but The <b>Happy Prince</b> is really moving. (Q29) I struggled with Tolkien’s The <b>Lord of the Rings</b> – there long books, and I <b>gave up</b> after one.","TREVOR:          It’s extremely popular, though.","STEPHANIE:     Yeah, but whereas <b>something like</b> The <b>Happy Prince</b> just carried me along with it, The <b>Lord of the Rings</b> took more effort than I was <b>prepared to give</b> it.","TREVOR:          I didn’t find that – I love it.","STEPHANIE:     <b>An<b>other one</b></b> I’ve read is War Horse.","TREVOR:          <b>Oh yes</b>. It’s about the First Word War, isn’t it? (Q30) Hardly what you’d expect for a children’s story.","STEPHANIE:     Exactly, but it’s been <b>very successful</b>. <b>Have you read</b> any …","#4 <b>Hunt for <b>sunken settlements</b></b> Transcript","The Part 4 <b>audio transcript</b> of <b>Hunt for <b>sunken settlements</b></b> and ancient<b> shipwrecks </b>in Cambridge 14 <b>Listening Test</b> 4 is as follows:","In today’s class I’m <b>going to talk</b> about marine archaeology, the branch of archaeology focusing on human interaction with the sea, lakes and rivers. It’s the study of ships, cargoes, shipping facilities, and other physical remains. I’ll give you an example, then go on to show how this <b>type of research</b> is being transformed by the use of the latest technology.","Atlit-Yam was a village on the coast of the eastern Mediterranean, which <b>seems to have</b> been thriving until around 7,000 BC. The<b> residents </b>kept cattle, caught fish and stored grain. They had wells for fresh water, many of their houses were built around a courtyard and were constructed of stone. The village contained an<b> impressive </b>monument: seven half-tonne stones standing in a<b> semicircle </b>around a (Q31) spring, that might <b>have been used</b> for ceremonial purposes.","Atlit-Yam may have been destroyed<b> swiftly </b>by a tsunami, or <b>climate change</b> may have caused<b> glaciers </b>to melt and <b>sea levels</b> to rise, flooding the village gradually. Whatever the cause, it now lies ten <b>metres below the surface</b> of the Mediterranean, buried under sand at the bottom of the sea.","For marine archaeologists, Atlit-Yam is a <b>treasure trove</b>. Research on the buildings, (Q32) tools and the <b>human remains</b> <b>has revealed</b> how the<b> bustling </b>village once functioned, and even what diseases some of its<b> residents </b>suffered from. But of course this is <b>only one</b> small village, one window into a lost world. For a<b> fuller </b>picture, researchers need more <b>sunken settlements</b>, but the <b>hard part</b> is finding them.","Autonomous underwater vehicles, or AUVs, are used in the oil industry, for instance, to create (Q33) maps of the<b> seabed </b>before<b> rigs </b>and pipelines are installed. To navigate they use sensors, <b>such as compasses</b> and sonar. Until relatively recently they were <b>very expensive</b>, and so (Q34) heavy that they had to be launched from a large<b> vessel </b>with a winch.","————————","But the latest AUVs are <b>much easier</b> to<b> manoeuvre </b>– they can be launched from the shore or a small ship. And they’re much cheaper, which makes them more accessible to research teams. They can communicate with <b>each other</b> and, for example, work out the <b>most efficient</b> way to survey a site, or to find particular objects on the seabed.","<b>Field tests</b> show the approach can work. For example, in a trial in 2015, three AUVs searched for<b> wrecks </b>at Marzamemi, off the coast of Sicily. The site is the final resting place of an <b>ancient Roman</b> ship, which sank in the <b>sixth century</b> AD while ferrying<b> prefabricated </b>(Q35) marble elements for the construction of an early church. The AUVs mapped the area in detail, finding other ships carrying columns of the <b>same material</b>.","Creating an internet in the sea for AUVs to communicate is no easy matter. Wifi networks on <b>land use</b><b> electromagnetic </b>waves, but in water these will only travel a <b>few centimetres</b>. Instead, a more complex mix of technologies is required. For short distances, AUVs can share date using (Q36) light, while acoustic waves are used to communicate over <b>long distances</b>.","There’s also a system that enables AUVs to share information from<b> seabed </b>scans, and other data. So if an AUV surveying the<b> seabed </b>finds an<b> intriguing </b>object, it can share the coordinates of the object – that is, its position – with a nearby AUV that carries<b> superior </b>(Q37) cameras, and arrange for that AUV to make a closer inspection of the object.","Marine archaeologists are excited about the huge potential of these AUVs for their discipline. <b>One site</b> where they’re going to be deployed is the Gulf of Baratti, off the Italian coast. In 1974, a 2,000-year-old Roman<b> vessel </b>was discovered here, in 18 metres of water. When it sank, it was carrying (Q38) medical goods, in wooden or<b> tin </b>receptacles. Its cargo <b>gives us insight</b> into the treatments available <b>all those years</b> ago, including tablets that are <b>thought to have</b> been<b> dissolved </b>to form a<b> cleansing </b>liquid for the (Q39) eyes.","Other Roman ships <b>went down</b> nearby, taking their cargo with them. Some held huge<b> pots </b>made of terracotta. Some were used for transporting cargoes of olive oil, and others held (Q40) wine. In many cases, it’s only these containers that remain, while the wooden ships have been buried under<b> silt </b>on the seabed.","Another project that’s about to …"]},{"name":"ALS/15-1","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Bankside Recruitment Agency Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of <b><b>Bankside Recruitment</b> Agency</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 1 is as follows:","AMBER:               Hello William.

I wouldn’t call her until the afternoon (Q2) if I were you – she’s always really busy in the morning trying to fill last-minute vacancies. She’s <b>really helpful</b> and friendly so I’m sure it would be worth getting in touch with her for an informal chat.","AMBER:               It’s mainly<b> clerical </b>and admin jobs they deal with, isn’t it?","WILLIAM:            That’s right. I know you’re<b> hoping </b>to find a full-time job in the media eventually – but Becky mostly recruits <b>temporary staff</b> for the finance sector – which will <b>look good</b> on your CV – and generally pays better too.","AMBER:               Yeah – I’m <b>just a bit</b> <b>worried because</b> I don’t <b>have much</b> office experience.","WILLIAM:            I wouldn’t worry. They’ll probably start you as a receptionist, or <b>something like</b> that. So what’s important for that kind of job isn’t so much having <b>business skills</b> or knowing <b>lots of different</b> computer systems – it’s communication (Q3) that <b>really matters</b> – so you’d be fine there.

It would be great if I could <b><b>get some</b>thing</b> lasting at <b>least a month</b>.","WILLIAM:            That shouldn’t be <b>too difficult</b>. But you’re more likely to be offered something for a week (Q4) at first. It’s<b> unusual </b>to be sent somewhere for just a day or two.","AMBER:               Right, I’ve heard the pay isn’t <b>too bad</b> – better than working in a<b> shop </b>or a restaurant.","WILLIAM:            <b>Oh yes</b> – definitely. The hourly rate is about £10 (Q5), 11 if you’re lucky.","AMBER:               That’s <b>pretty good</b>.

It’s just a chance for them to build a relationship with you – so they can try and match you to a job which you’ll like.

My name’s Erica Matthews, and I’m the owner of <b>Matthews Island</b> Holidays, a company <b>set up</b> by my parents. <b>Thank you for coming</b> to this presentation, in which I hope to interest you in what we have to offer.","We’re a small, family-run company, and we believe in the importance of the personal touch, so we don’t aim to compete with other companies on the number of customers. What we do is build on our many years’ experience – more than <b>almost any</b> other rail holiday company (Q11) – to ensure we provide perfect holidays in a <b>small number</b> of destinations, which we’ve got to know <b>extremely well</b>.","I’ll start with our six-day <b>Isle of Man</b> holiday. This is a fascinating island in the Irish Sea, with Wales to the south, England to the east, Scotland to the north and Northern Ireland to the west. Our holiday starts in Heysham, where your tour manager will meet you (Q12), then you’ll travel by <b>ferry to the Isle</b> of Man.","Some <b>people prefer</b> to fly from Luton instead, and <b>another popular</b> option is to go by train to Liverpool and take a<b> ferry </b>from there.","You have five nights in the hotel, and the price covers five breakfasts and dinners, and lunch on the <b>three days</b> when there are organised trips (Q13): <b>day four</b> is free, and <b><b>most people</b> have</b> lunch in a café or restaurant in Douglas.","The price of the holiday includes the <b>ferry to the Isle</b> of Man, all travel on the island, the hotel, and the meals I’ve mentioned. Incidentally, we <b>try to make</b> booking our holidays as simple and fair as possible, so unlike with many companies, the price is the same whether you book six <b>months in advance</b> or at the last minute, and there’s no supplement for <b>single rooms</b> in hotels.","If you make a booking then <b>need to change</b> the start date, for example because of illness, you’re welcome to change to an alternative date or a different tour, for a small administrative fee. (Q14)","——————————-","OK, so what does the holiday consist of? Well, on <b>day one</b> you’ll arrive in time for a short introduction by your tour manager, followed by dinner in the hotel. The <b>dining room</b> looks out at the river (Q15), close to where it flows into the harbour, and there’s usually plenty of activity going on.","On day two you’ll take the coach to the <b>small town</b> of Peel, on the way calling in at the Tynwald Exhibition. The <b>Isle of Man</b> isn’t part of the United Kingdom, and it <b>has its own</b> parliament, called Tynwald.","It’s claimed that this is the world’s oldest parliament that’s still functioning, and that it <b>dates back</b> to 979. However, the earliest surviving<b> reference </b>to it is from 1422 (Q16), so perhaps it isn’t quite as old as it claims!","Day three we have a trip to the mountain Snaefell. This begins with a leisurely ride along the<b> promenade </b>in Douglas in a horse-drawn tram. Then you board an electric train which takes you to the fishing village of Laxey.","From there it’s an eight-kilometre ride in the Snaefell Mountain Railway to the top (Q17). Lunch will be in the café, giving you <b>spectacular views</b> of the island.","<b>Day four</b> is free for you to explore, using the pass (Q18) which we’ll give you. So you won’t <b>have to pay</b> for travel on local transport, or for entrance to the island’s<b> heritage </b>sites.","Or you might <b>just want</b> to <b>take it easy</b> in Douglas and perhaps <b>do a little</b> light shopping.","The last full day, day five, is for <b>some people</b> the highlight of the holiday, with a ride on the steam (Q19) railway, from Douglas to Port Erin. After <b>some time</b> to explore, a coach will take you to the headlan. That overlooks the Calf of Man, a <b>small island</b> just off the coast.","From there you continue to Castletown, which used to be the capital (Q20) of the <b>Isle of Man</b>, and its<b> mediaeval </b>castle.","And on day six it’s back to the<b> ferry </b>– or the airport, if you flew to the island – and time to go home.","Now I’d <b>like to tell</b> you …","#3 <b>Personality traits</b> Transcript","The Part 3 <b>audio transcript</b> of <b>Personality traits</b> in Cambridge 15 <b>Listening Test</b> 1 is as follows:","RUTH:   Ed, how are you getting on with the reading for our presentation <b>next week</b>?","ED:         Well, OK, Ruth – but there’s so much of it.","RUTH:   I know, I hadn’t realised <b>birth order</b> was such a popular area of research.","ED:         But the stuff on <b>birth order</b> and personality is mostly unreliable. From what I’ve been reading a lot of claims about how your position in the family determines certain <b>personality traits</b> are just stereotypes, with no robust <b>evidence to support</b> them.","RUTH:   OK, but that’s an interesting point – we could start by outlining what previous <b><b>research has</b> shown</b>. There are studies <b>going back</b> over a <b>hundred years</b>.","ED:         Yeah – so we could <b>just <b>run through some</b></b> of the typical traits. Like the<b> consensus </b>seems to be that <b>oldest children</b> are generally less well-adjusted. Because they <b>never get</b> over the arrival of a younger sibling.","RUTH:   Right, but on a positive note, <b>some studies</b> claimed that they were thought to be good a nurturing – certainly in the past when <b>people had</b> large families they would <b>have been expected</b> to look after the younger ones. (Q21)","ED:         There isn’t such a <b>clear picture</b> for middle children – but one trait that a lot of the studies mention is that they are <b>easier to get</b> on with than older or <b>younger siblings</b>.","RUTH:   Generally eager to please and helpful (Q22) – although that’s certainly not <b>accurate as far</b> as my family goes – my middle brother was a nightmare – always causing fights and<b> envious </b>of whatever I had.","ED:         As I said – none of this seems to relate to my <b>own experience</b>. I’m the youngest in my family and I don’t recognise myself in any of the studies I’ve read about. I’m supposed to have been a<b> sociable </b>and confident child who made friends easily (Q23) – but I was actually<b> terribly </b>shy.","RUTH:   Really? That’s funny. There have been hundreds of studies on twins but mostly about nurture versus nature…","ED:         There was one on personality, which said that a twin is likely to be quite shy in<b> social </b>situations (Q24) because they <b>always have</b> their twin around to depend on for support.","RUTH:   My cousins were like that when they were small – they were only interested in <b>each other</b> and hard to engage with other kids. They’re fine now though.","ED:         Only <b>children have</b> <b>had a really</b> bad press – a lot of <b>studies have</b> branded them as<b> loners </b>who think the world<b> revolves </b>around them (Q25) because they’ve <b>never had</b> to fight for their parents’ attention.","RUTH:   That <b>does seem</b> a bit harsh. One category I hadn’t considered before was children with <b>much older</b> siblings – a couple of studies mentioned that these children <b>grow up</b> more quickly and are expected to do basic things for themselves – like getting dressed. (Q26)","ED:         I can see how that might be true – although I expect they’re sometimes the exact<b> opposite </b>– playing the baby role and<b> clamouring </b>for special treatment.","——————————–","RUTH:   What was the problem with most of these studies, <b>do you think</b>?","ED:         I think it was because in a lot of cases data was collected from <b>only one</b> sibling per family, who rated him or herself and his or her siblings at the <b>same time</b>.","RUTH:   Mmm. Some of the old research into the relationship between <b>birth order</b> and academic achievement <b>has been proved</b> to be accurate though. Performances in intelligence tests decline slightly from the eldest child to his or her <b>younger siblings</b>. This <b>has been proved</b> in lots of <b>recent studies</b>.","ED:         Yes. Although what many of them didn’t take into consideration was family size (Q27). The more siblings there are, the<b> likelier </b>the family is to have a low <b>socioeconomic status</b>. Which can also account for differences between siblings in <b>academic performance</b>.","RUTH:   The oldest boy might be given more<b> opportunities </b>than his younger sisters, for example.","ED:         Exactly.","RUTH:   But the <b>main reason</b> for the marginally higher <b>academic performance</b> of <b>oldest children</b> is quite surprising, I think. It’s not only that they benefit intellectually from extra attention at a <b>young age</b> – which is what I would <b>have expected</b>. It’s that they benefit from being teachers for their <b>younger siblings</b>, by<b> verbalising </b>processes. (Q28)","ED:         Right, and this gives them status and confidence, which again contribute, in a small way, to better performance.","So would you say sibling<b> rivalry </b>has been a useful thing for you?","RUTH:   I think so – my <b>younger brother</b> was incredibly annoying and we found a lot but I think this <b>has made</b> me a stronger person. I know how to defend myself (Q29/Q30). We <b>had some</b> terrible arguments and I would <b>have died</b> rather than apologise to him – but we had to <b>put up</b> with <b>each other</b> (Q29/Q30) and <b>most of the time</b> we co-existed<b> amicably </b>enough.","ED:         Yes, my situation was pretty similar. But I don’t <b>think having</b> two older brothers <b>made me</b> any less selfish – I was never prepared to <b>let me</b> brothers <b>use any</b> of my stuff …","RUTH:   That’s perfectly normal, whereas …","#4 The <b>Eucalyptus <b>tree in Australia</b></b> Transcript","The Part 4 <b>audio script</b> of The <b>Eucalyptus <b>tree in Australia</b></b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 1 is as follows:","Today I’m <b>going to talk</b> about the <b>eucalyptus tree</b>. This is a <b>very common</b> tree here in Australia, where it’s <b>also some</b>times called the gum tree. First I’m <b>going to talk</b> about why it’s important, then I’m going to describe <b>some problems</b> it faces at present.","Right, well the <b>eucalyptus tree</b> is an important tree for lots of reasons. For example, it gives shelter (Q31) to <b>creatures like</b> birds and bats, and these and <b>other species</b> also depend on it for food, particularly the<b> nectar </b>from its flowers. So it supports biodiversity. It’s useful to us humans too, because we can kill germs with a<b> disinfectant </b>made from oil (Q32) extracted from<b> eucalyptus </b>leaves.","The<b> eucalyptus </b>grows all over Australia and the trees can live for up to <b>four <b>hundred years</b></b>. So it’s alarming that all across the country, <b>numbers of eucalyptus</b> are falling because the trees are<b> dying </b>off prematurely. So what are the reasons for this?","<b>One <b>possible reason</b></b> is disease. As <b>far back</b> as the 1970s the trees started getting a <b>disease called</b> Mundulla Yellows. The trees’ leaves would gradually turn yellow, then the tree would die. It wasn’t until 2004 that they found the cause of the problem was lime, or calcium<b> hydroxide </b>to give it its proper chemical name, <b>used in the construction</b> of roads (Q33).","The<b> lime </b>was being <b>washed away</b> into the ground and affecting the roots of the <b><b>eucalyptus tree</b>s</b> nearby. What is was doing was preventing the trees from <b>sucking up</b> the iron they needed for healthy growth. When this was injected back into the affected trees, they immediately recovered.","But this problem only affected a <b>relatively small</b> <b>number of trees</b>. By 2000, huge <b>numbers of eucalyptus</b> were<b> dying </b>along Australia’s <b>East Coast</b>, of a <b>disease known</b> as Bell-miner Associated Die-back. The bell-miner is a bird, and the disease seems to be common where there are high populations of bell-miners.","Again it’s the leaves of the trees that are affected. What happens is that insects (Q34) settle on the leaves and eat their way round them, destroying them as they go, and at the <b>same time</b> they<b> secrete </b>a solution which has sugar in it. The bell-miner birds <b>really like</b> this solution, and in <b>order to get</b> as much as possible. They keep away other creatures that might <b>try to get</b> it. So these <b>birds and insects</b> flourish at the expense of <b>other species</b>. And eventually so much damage is done to the leaves that the tree dies.","————————–","But experts say that trees can <b>start looking</b> sick before <b>any sign</b> of Bell-miner Associated Die-back. So it looks as if the problem might <b>have another</b> explanation. <b>One possibility</b> is that it’s to do with the huge<b> bushfires </b>that we have in Australia. A theory proposed over 40 <b>years ago</b> be<b> ecologist </b>William Jackson is that the <b>frequency of bushfires</b> in a particular region affects the type of<b> vegetation </b>that grows there. If there are very <b>frequent bushfires</b> in a region, this <b>encourages grass</b> (Q35) to grow afterwards, while if the<b> bushfires </b>are <b>rather less</b> frequent, this results in the <b>growth of eucalyptus</b> forests.","So why is this? Why do fairly <b>frequent bushfires</b> actually support the <b>growth of eucalyptus</b>? Well, <b>one reason</b> is that the fire stops the growth of <b>other species</b> which would consume water (Q36) needed by <b><b>eucalyptus tree</b>s</b>. And there’s <b>another reason</b>.","If these other quick-growing<b> species </b>of bushes and plants are allowed to proliferate, they harm the<b> eucalyptus </b>in <b>another way</b>, by <b>affecting the composition</b> of the soil (Q37), and removing nutrients from it. So some<b> bushfires </b>are actually essential for the<b> eucalyptus </b>to <b>survive as long</b> as they are not too frequent. In fact there’s evidence that Australia’s<b> indigenous </b>people practised regular burning of bush land for <b>thousands of years</b> before the arrival of the Europeans.","But since <b>Europeans arrived</b> on the continent, the number of<b> bushfires </b>has been strictly controlled. Now scientists believe that this reduced <b>frequency of bushfires</b> to <b>low levels</b> had led to what’s known as ‘dry (Q38) rainforest’, which seems an odd name as usually we associate <b>tropical rainforest</b> with wet conditions.","And what’s special about this type of rainforest? Well, unlike <b>tropical rainforest</b> which is a rich ecosystem, this type of ecosystem is usually a simple (Q39) one. It <b>has very</b> thick, dense vegetation, but not much <b>variety of species</b>. The<b> vegetation </b>provides lots of shade, so <b>one species</b> that does find it ideal is the bell-miner bird, which builds its nests (Q40) in the undergrowth there. But again that’s not helpful for the <b>eucalyptus tree</b>."]},{"name":"ALS/15-2","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Festival information Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of <b>Festival information</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 2 is as follows:","TIM:       <b>Good morning</b>.

Over to you, Mark.","MARK:","Thank you. I’m sure you’re <b>all familiar</b> with <b>Minster Park</b>. It’s been a feature of the city for well over a century, and has been the<b> responsibility </b>of the <b>city council</b> for most of that time. What perhaps isn’t so <b>well known</b> is the origin of the park: <b>un<b>like many</b></b> public parks that started in private ownership, as the garden of a large house, for instance, Minster was some waste land, which <b>people living</b> nearby started planting with flowers in 1892 (Q11). It was unclear who actually owned the land, and this wasn’t settled until 20 <b>years later</b>, when the council took possession of it.","You may <b><b>have no</b>ticed</b> the<b> statue </b>near one of the entrances. It’s of <b>Diane Gosforth</b>, who played a <b>key role</b> in the history of the park. Once the council <b>had become</b> the legal owner, it planned to sell the land for housing. Many <b>local people</b> (Q12) wanted it to remain a place that everyone could go to, to enjoy the <b>fresh air</b> and <b>natural environment</b> – remember the park is in a densely populated<b> residential </b>area. <b>Diane Gosforth</b> was one of those people, and she organised petitions and demonstrations (Q12), which eventually made the council <b>change its mind</b> about the future of the land.","Soon after this the <b><b>First World</b> War</b> broke out, in 1914, and most of the park was dug up and planted with vegetables (Q13), which were sold locally. At one stage the army considered taking in over for troop exercises and got as far as contacting the <b>city council</b>, then decided the park was <b>too small</b> to be of use. There were occasional public meetings during the war, in an <b>area that had</b> been retained as grass.","After the war, the park was turned back more or less to how it had been before 1914, and continued almost unchanged <b>until recently</b>. Plans for transforming it were <b>drawn up</b> at various times, <b>most recently</b> in 2013, though they were revised in 2015, before any work <b>had started</b>. The changes finally got going in 2016 (Q14), and were finished on schedule <b>last year</b>.","————————-","OK, <b>let <b>me tell</b></b> you about <b><b><b>some of the changes</b> that have</b> been made</b> – and <b>some things</b> that have been retained. If you look at this map, you’ll see the familiar outline of the park, with the river forming the northern boundary, and a gate in each of the other three walls. The<b> statue </b>of <b>Diane Gosforth</b> has been moved: it used to be close to the <b>south gate</b>, but it’s now immediately to the north of the lily pond, almost in the <b>centre of the park</b> (Q15), which <b>makes it much</b> more visible.","There’s a <b>new area</b> of wooden sculptures, which are on the river bank, where the path from the east gate makes a sharp bend. (Q16)","There are two areas that are particularly intended for children. The playground has been enlarged and improved, and that’s between the river and the <b>path that leads</b> from the pond to the river. (Q17)","Then there’s a new maze, a circular series of paths,<b> separated </b>by low hedges. That’s near the <b>west gate</b> – you go north from there towards the river and then turn left to reach it. (Q18)","There have been <b>tennis courts</b> in the park for many years, and they’ve been doubled, from four to eight. They’re still in the south-west corner of the park, where there’s a right-angle <b>bend in the path</b>. (Q19)","Something else I’d <b>like to mention</b> is the new fitness area. This is <b>right next</b> to the lily pond on the <b>same side</b> as the <b>west gate</b>. (Q20)","Now, as you’re all gardeners, I’m sure you’ll <b>like to hear</b> about the <b>plants that have</b> been chosen for the park.","#3 Cathy & <b>Graham novels</b> Transcript","The Part 3 <b>audio script</b> of Cathy & <b>Graham novels</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 2 is as follows:","CATHY:                 OK, Graham, so let’s check we both know what we’re supposed to be doing.","GRAHAM:            OK.","CATHY:                 So, for the university’s open day, we <b>have to plan</b> a display on British life and literature in the mid-19th century.","GRAHAM:            That’s right. But we’ll <b>have some</b> <b>people to help</b> us find the materials and set it up, remember – for the moment, we <b>just need</b> to plan it.","CATHY:                 Good. So have you gathered who’s expected to <b>come and see</b> the display? Is it for the people studying English, or students from other departments? I’m not clear about it.","GRAHAM:            Nor me. That was how it used to be, but it didn’t attract <b>many people</b>, so this year it’s <b>going to be part</b> of an open day, to raise the university’s profile. It’ll be<b> publicised </b>in the city, to <b>encourage people</b> to come and <b>find out something</b> of what does on here (Q21/Q22). And it’s included in the information that’s sent to people who are considering applying to study <b>here next</b> year. (Q21/Q22)","CATHY:                <b> Presumably </b>some current students and<b> lecturers </b>will come?","GRAHAM:            I would imagine so, but we’ve been told to<b> concentrate </b>on the other categories of people.","CATHY:                 Right. We don’t have to cover the <b>whole range</b> of 19th-century literature, do we?","GRAHAM:            No, it’s <b>entirely up</b> to us. I suggest just using Charles Dickens.","CATHY:                 That’s a <b>good idea</b>. <b><b>Most people</b> have</b> heard of him, and have probably read some of his novels, or seen films based on them (Q23/Q24), so that’s a good lead-in to life in his time.","GRAHAM:            Exactly. And his novels show the awful conditions that <b>most people</b> had to live in, don’t they: he wanted to shock people into <b><b>doing some</b>thing</b> about it. (Q23/Q24)","CATHY:                 Did he <b>do any</b> campaigning, other than writing?","GRAHAM:            Yes, he campaigned for education and <b>other social</b> reforms, and gave talks, but I’m inclined to ignore that and focus on the novels.","CATHY:                 Yes, I agree.","————————–","CATHY:                 OK, so now shall we think about a topic linked to each novel?","GRAHAM:            Yes. I’ve printed out a list of Dicken’s novels in the order they were published, in the hope you’d agree to focus on him!","CATHY:                 You’re lucky I did agree! Let’s <b>have a look</b>. OK, the first was The Pickwick Papers, published in 1836. It was <b>very successful</b> when it came out, wasn’t it, and was adapted for the theatre <b>straight away</b>.","GRAHAM:            There’s an interesting point, though, that there’s a character who keeps falling asleep, and that medical condition was named after the book – Pickwickian Syndrome. (Q25)","CATHY:                 Oh, so why don’t we use that as the topic, and include some<b> quotations </b>from the novel?","GRAHAM:            Right, Next is Oliver Twist. There’s a lot in the novel about poverty. But <b>maybe something</b> <b>less obvious</b> …","CATHY:                 Well Oliver is taught how to steal, isn’t he? We could use that to illustrate the fact that <b>very few</b> children went to school, particularly not poor children, so they<b> learnt </b>in <b>other ways</b>. (Q26)","GRAHAM:            <b>Good idea</b>. What’s next?","CATHY:                 Maybe Nicholas Nickleby. Actually he taught in a really cruel school, didn’t he?","GRAHAM:            That’s right. But there’s also the company of touring actors that Nicholas joins. We could <b><b>do some</b>thing</b> on theatres and other amusements of the time. (Q27) We don’t want only the bad things, do we?","CATHY:                 OK.","GRAHAM:            What about Martin Chuzzlewit? He goes to the USA, doesn’t he?","CATHY:                 Yes, and Dickens himself had been there a year before, and<b> drew </b>on his experience there in the novel. (Q28)","GRAHAM:            I wonder, though … The main theme is selfishness, so we could <b><b>do some</b>thing</b> on<b> social </b>justice? No, too general, let’s keep to your idea – I think it would <b>work well</b>.","CATHY:                 He wrote Bleak House next – that’s my favourite of his novels.","GRAHAM:            Yes, <b>mine too</b>. His<b> satire </b>of the legal system is pretty powerful.","CATHY:                 That’s true, but think about Esther, the heroine. As a child she lives with someone she doesn’t know is her aunt, who treats her very badly. Then she’s <b>very happy</b> living with her guardian, and he puts her in charge of the household.

This is a dry and<b> arid </b>region, with unpredictable rainfall. Because of this, <b>people in the area</b> were unable to support themselves through agriculture and instead they used the forest as a means of providing themselves with an income, mainly by selling charcoal. However, this was not a <b>sustainable way</b> of living in the <b>long term</b>, as they were rapidly using up this resource.","To support agriculture in this dry region, the programme focused primarily on <b>making use</b> of existing water resources from the <b>Limpopo River</b> by <b>setting up</b> systems of irrigation (Q31), which would provide a dependable <b>water supply</b> for crops and animals. The <b>programme worked</b> closely with the district government in <b>order to find</b> the <b>best way</b> of implementing this. The region <b>already had</b> one farmers’ association, and it was decided to <b>set up</b> two more of these. These associations <b>planned and carried</b> out activities including water management,<b> livestock </b>breeding and agriculture, and it was notable that in general, women (Q32) formed the majority of the workforce.","It was <b>decided that in order</b> to keep the crops safe from animals, both wild and domestic, special areas should be fenced off where the crops could be grown. The community was<b> responsible </b>for creating these fences, but the <b>programme <b>provided the necessary</b></b> wire (Q33) for making them.","Once the area had been fenced off, it could be cultivated. The land was dug, so that vegetables and<b> cereals </b>appropriate to the climate could be grown, and the <b>programme <b>provided the necessary</b></b> seeds (Q34) for this. The programme <b><b>also provide</b>d</b><b> pumps </b>so that water could be brought from the river in pipes to the fields. However, the<b> labour </b>was all provided by <b>local people</b>, and they <b><b>also provide</b>d</b> and <b>put up</b> the posts (Q35) that supported the fences around the fields.","———————-","Once the programme had been <b>set up</b>, its development was monitored carefully. The farmers were able to <b>grow enough</b> produce not just for their own needs, but also to sell. However, getting the produce to places where it could be marketed was sometimes a problem, as the farmers did not <b>have access</b> to transport (Q36), and this resulted in <b><b>large amount</b>s</b> of produce, especially vegetables, being spoiled. This problem was discussed with the farmers’ associations and it was <b>decided that in order</b> to prevent food from being spoiled, the farmers needed to <b>learn techniques</b> for its preservation. (Q37)","There was also an additional initiative that <b>had no</b>t been originally planned, but which became a <b>central feature</b> of the programme. This was when farmers started to dig holes for tanks in the fenced-off areas and to fill these with water and use them for breeding fish (Q38) – an important <b>source of protein</b>. After a time, another suggestion was made by <b>local people</b> which hadn’t been part of the programme’s original proposal, but which was also adopted later on. They <b>decided to try</b> <b>setting up</b> colonies of bees (Q39), which would provide honey both for their own consumption and to sell.","So what lessons can be learned from this programme? <b>First of all</b>, it tells us that in dry,<b> arid </b>regions, if there is access to a reliable source of water, there is great potential for the development of agriculture. In Chicualacuala, there was a marked improvement in agricultural production, which improved food security and benefited <b>local people</b> by providing them with both food and income.

So thank you for sending in your CV. We’ve had quite a careful look at it and I <b>think we have</b> two jobs that might be suitable for you.","JOE:       OK.","SALLY:   The <b>first one</b> is in a <b>company based</b> in <b>North London</b>. They’re looking for an administrative assistant.","JOE:       OK. What sort of company is it?","SALLY:   They’re called Home Solutions and they design and make furniture. (Q1)","JOE:       Oh, I don’t <b>know much</b> about that, but it <b>sounds interesting</b>.","SALLY:   Yes, well as I said, they <b><b>want some</b>one</b> in their office, and looking at your past experience it does look as if you fit <b>quite a few</b> of the requirements. So on your CV it appears you’ve <b>done some</b> data entry?","JOE:       Yes.","SALLY:   So that’s one skill they want. Then they expect the person they appoint to attend meetings (Q2) and <b><b>take no</b>tes</b> there …","JOE:       OK. I’ve done that before, yes.","SALLY:   And you’d <b>need to be able</b> to cope with general admin.","JOE:       Filling, and keeping records and so on? That should be OK. And in my last job I <b>also had</b> to manage the diary. (Q3)","SALLY:   Excellent. That’s something they want <b>here too</b>. I’d suggest you add it to your CV – I don’t think you mentioned that, did you?","JOE:       No.","SALLY:   So as far as the requirements go, they want good computer skills, of course, and they particularly mention spreadsheets.","JOE:       That should be fine.","SALLY:   And<b> interpersonal </b>skills – which would be something they’d check with your references.","JOE:       I think that should be OK, yes.","SALLY:   Then they <b><b>mention that they want</b> someone</b> who is careful and <b>takes care</b> with details (Q4) – <b>just look</b>ing at your CV, I’d say you’re probably alright there.","JOE:       I think so, yes.

For those of you that don’t <b>already know</b> – <b>Street Play</b> involves <b>local residents</b> closing off their street for a <b>few hours</b> so that <b>children have</b> a <b>chance to play</b> in the street safely. She started it in her own street, <b>Beechwood Road</b>, and the idea caught on, and there are now <b>Street <b>Play Scheme</b></b>s all over the city. So when did you actually start the scheme, Alice?","ALICE:","Well, I <b>first had</b> the idea when my oldest child was still a toddler, so that’s about <b>six years</b> ago now – but it <b>took at least</b> two <b>years of campaigning</b> before we were <b>actually able</b> to make it happen. So the scheme’s been up and running for <b>three years</b> now (Q11). We’d love to be able to close our road for longer – for the whole weekend, from Saturday <b>morning until</b> Sunday evening, for example. At the moment it’s just <b>once a week</b> (Q12). But when we started it was <b>only once</b> a month. But we’re working on it.","PRESENTER:","So what actually happens when <b>Beechwood Road</b> is closed?","ALICE:","We have volunteer wardens, mostly parents but some elderly<b> residents </b>too, who block off our road at either end (Q13). The council <b>have provided</b> special signs but there’s always a volunteer there to explain what’s happening to any motorists.","Now I should explain that the road isn’t completely closed to cars. But only residents’ cars are allowed. If <b><b>people really</b> need</b> to get in or out of <b>Beechwood Road</b>, it’s not a problem – as long as they drive at under 20 <b><b>kilometres per</b> hour</b> (Q14). But <b>most people</b> just decide not to <b>use their cars</b> during this time, or they park in another street. The<b> wardens </b>are only there to stop through traffic.","PRESENTER:","So can anyone apply to <b>get involved</b> in <b>Street Play</b>?","ALICE:","Absolutely – we <b>want to include</b> all kids in the city – especially those who live on <b>busy roads</b> (Q15). It’s here that demand is greatest. Obviously, there isn’t such demand in wealthier areas where the <b>children have</b> access to parks or large gardens – or in the<b> suburbs </b>where there are usually more places for children to play outside.","I’d recommend that anyone listening who likes the idea should <b>just give</b> it a go. And that’s not <b>just parents</b>. There are always a few who complain but they’re a tiny minority. On the whole everyone is very supportive and say they’re <b>very happy</b> to see children out on the street (Q16) – even if it does <b>get quite</b> noisy.","——————-","ALICE:","There have been so many benefits of <b>Street Play</b> for the kids. Parents really <b>like the fact</b> that the kids are getting <b>fresh air</b> instead of sitting staring at a computer screen, even if they’re not <b>doing anything</b> particularly energetic. And of course it’s great that kids can play with their friends outside without being<b> supervised </b>by their parents – but for me the biggest advantage is that kids develop confidence in themselves to be outside without their parents (Q17/Q18). The other really fantastic thing is that children <b>get to know</b> the adults in the street – it’s like <b>having a big</b> extended family (Q17/Q18).","PRESENTER:","It <b><b>certainly do</b>es</b> <b>have a lot</b> of benefits. I want to <b>move on now</b> and ask you about a related project in <b>King Street</b>.","ALICE:","Right. Well this was an experiment I was involved in where <b>local residents</b> <b>decided to try</b> and reduce the traffic along <b>King Street</b>, which is the busiest <b>main road</b> in our area, by persuading people not to <b>use their cars</b> for <b>one day</b>. We thought about <b>making people</b> pay more for parking – but we decided that would be really unpopular – so instead we just stopped people from parking on <b>King Street</b> but left the other <b><b>car park</b>s</b> open.","It was surprising how much of a difference all this made. As we’d predicted, <b>air quality</b> was significantly better but what I hadn’t expected was how much quieter it would be (Q19/Q20) – even with the buses still running. Of course everyone <b>said they felt</b> safer but we were actually amazed that sales in the shops <b>went up</b> considerably that day (Q19/Q20) – we thought there’d be <b>fewer people</b> out shopping – not more.","PRESENTER:","That’s <b>really interesting</b> so the fact that …","#3 <b>Hazel <b>newspaper articles</b></b> Transcript","The Part 3 <b>audio transcript</b> of <b>Hazel <b>newspaper articles</b></b> in Cambridge 15 <b>Listening Test</b> 3 is as follows:","HAZEL:  Tom, could I ask you for <b>some advice</b>, please?","TOM:     Yes of course, if you think I can help.

For example, there’s the question of which page (Q21) of the newspaper the item appears on.","HAZEL:  You mean, because there’s a <b>big difference</b> between having it on the front page and the bottom of page ten, for instance?","TOM:     Exactly. And that shows how important the editor thinks the story is. Then there’s the size (Q22) – how many column inches the story is given, how many columns it spreads over.","HAZEL:  And I suppose that includes the headline.","TOM:     It <b><b>certainly do</b>es</b>. It’s all part of attracting the reader’s attention.","HAZEL:  What about graphics (Q23) – whether there’s anything visual in addition to the text?","TOM:     Yes, you <b>need to consider</b> those, too, because they can <b>have a big</b> effect on the reader’s understanding of the story – sometimes a bigger effect than the text itself. Then you’ll <b>need to look</b> at how the item is put together: what structure (Q24) is it given? <b>Bear in mind</b> that not <b>many people</b> read beyond the first paragraph, so what has the<b> journalist </b>put at the beginning? And if, say, three are conflicting opinions about something, does one appear near the end, where people probably won’t read it?","HAZEL:  And newspapers sometimes give <b>wrong or misleading</b> information, don’t they?","Either deliberately or by accident. Should I be looking at that, too?","TOM:     Yes, if you can. Compare what’s in different versions, and as far as possible, try and work out what’s true and what isn’t. And that relates to a very <b>important point</b>: what’s the writer’s purpose (Q25), or at least the <b>most important</b> one, if they <b>have several</b>. It may seem to be to inform the public, but often it’s that they want to create fear, or controversy, or to <b>make some</b>body look ridiculous.","HAZEL:  Gosh, I <b>see what you mean</b>. And I suppose the writer may make assumptions (Q26) about the reader.","TOM:     That’s right – about their knowledge of the subject, their attitudes, and their level of education, which means writing so that the readers understand without feeling patronised. All of that will make a difference.","———————-","HAZEL:  Does it matter what type of story I write about?","TOM:     No – national or international politics, the arts … Anything, as long as it’s covered in <b>two or three</b> newspaper. <b>Though of course</b> it’ll be easier and more fun if it’s something you’re interested in and <b>know something</b> about.","HAZEL:  And on that basis a national news item would be worth analysing – I’m quite keen on politics, so I’ll try and find a suitable topic (Q27). What <b>did you choose</b> for your analysis, Tom?","TOM:     I was interested in how newspapers express their opinions explicitly, so I wanted to compare editorials in different papers, but when I <b>started looking</b>. I couldn’t find two on the same topic (Q28) that I felt like analysing.","HAZEL:  In that case, I won’t even bother to look (Q28).","TOM:     So in the end I chose a human interest story – a<b> terribly </b>emotional story about a <b>young girl</b> who was very ill, and <b><b>lots of other</b> people</b> – mostly strangers – raised money so she could <b>go abroad</b> for treatment. Actually, I was surprised – some papers just wrote about how wonderful everyone was, but others considered the broader picture, like why treatment wasn’t available here.","HAZEL:  Hmm, I <b>usually find</b> <b>stories like</b> that raise quite strong feelings in me! I’ll avoid that (Q29). Perhaps I’ll choose an arts topic (Q30), like different reviews of a film, or something about funding for the arts – I’ll think about that.","TOM:     Yes, that might be interesting.","HAZEL:  OK, well <b>thanks a lot</b> for your help, Tom.

Since water is essential for life, the earliest <b>people lived</b> near water and knew something about its<b> cleansing </b>properties – at least that it<b> rinsed </b>mud off (Q31) their hands.","During the<b> excavation </b>of ancient Babylon, evidence was found that<b> soapmaking </b>was known as early as 2800 BC. Archaeologists discovered<b> cylinders </b>made of clay (Q32), with<b> inscriptions </b>on them saying that fats were boiled with askes. This is a method of making soap, though there’s no<b> reference </b>to the purpose of this material.","The early Greeks bathed for aesthetic reasons and apparently didn’t use soap. Instead, they cleaned their bodies with blocks of sand,<b> pumice </b>and ashes, then<b> anointed </b>themselves with oil, and<b> scraped </b>off the oil and dirt with a metal instrument known as a strigil (Q33). They <b><b>also use</b>d</b> oil mixed with ashes. Clothes were washed without soap in streams.","The ancient Germans and Gauls are also credited with discovering how to make a substance called ‘soap’, made of melted <b>animal fat</b> and ashes. They used this mixture to<b> tint </b>their hair red (Q34).","Soap got its name, according to an <b>ancient Roman</b> legend, from Mount Sapo, where animals were sacrificed, leaving deposits of <b>animal fat</b>. Rain washed these deposits, along with wood ashes, down into the clay soil along the River Tiber. Women found that this mixture greatly reduced the <b>effort required</b> to wash their clothes.","As Roman civilisation advance, so did bathing. The first of the famous Roman baths, supplied with water from their<b> aqueducts </b>(Q35). It was built around 312 BC. The baths were luxurious, and bathing became <b>very popular</b>. And by the <b>second century</b> AD, the Greek<b> physician </b>Galen recommended soap for both<b> medicinal </b>and cleaning purposes.","————————–","After the fall of Rome in 467 AD and the resulting decline in bathing habits, much of Europe felt the impact of filth on public health. This lack of personal<b> cleanliness </b>and related<b> unsanitary </b>living conditions were major factors in the outbreaks of disease (Q36) in the <b>Middle Ages</b>, and especially the Black Death of the 14th century.","Nevertheless, <b>soapmaking became</b> an established<b> craft </b>in Europe, and associations of<b> soapmakers </b>guarded their trade secrets closely. Vegetable and animal oils were used with ashes of plants, along with perfume, apparently for the <b>first time</b> (Q37). Gradually more varieties of soap <b>became available</b> for<b> shaving </b>and shampooing, as well as bathing and laundering.","<b>A </b> major step toward large-scale commercial<b> soapmaking </b>occurred in 1791, when a French chemist, Nicholas Leblanc,<b> patented </b>a process for turning salt into <b>soda ash</b> (Q38), or<b> sodium </b>carbonate. <b>Soda ash</b> is the<b> alkali </b>obtained from ashes. That combines with fat to form soap. The Leblanc process yielded quantities of good-quality,<b> inexpensive </b><b>soda ash</b>.","Modern<b> soapmaking </b>was born some 20 <b>years later</b>, in the early 19th century, with the discovery by Michel Eugène Chevreul, another French chemist, of the chemical nature and relationship of fats,<b> glycerine </b>and fatty acids. His studies established the basis for both fat and soap chemistry, and <b>soapmaking became</b> a science (Q39). Further developments during the 19th century made it easier and <b>cheaper to manufacture</b> soap.","Until the 19th century, soap was regarded as a luxury item, and was heavily taxed in <b>several countries</b>. As it became more readily available, it became an everyday necessity, a development that was reinforced when the high tax was removed (Q40). Soap was then something <b>ordinary people</b> could afford, and<b> cleanliness </b>standards improved.","With this widespread use came the development of<b> milder </b>soaps for bathing and soaps for use in the washing machines that were available to consumers by the turn of the 20th century."]},{"name":"ALS/15-4","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Customer Satisfaction Survey Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of the <b><b>Customer Satisfaction</b> Survey</b> <b><b>listening <b>answers in Listening</b></b> Test</b> 4 is as follows:","MAN:                    Hello.

It’s on a <b>bend in the path</b> that <b>goes round</b> the east <b>side of the lake</b>, just south of the <b>adventure playground</b>. (Q16)","———————–","Now <b>let <b>me <b>tell you a bit</b></b></b> more about <b>some of the changes</b> to <b><b>Croft Valley</b> Park</b>.","One of our most exciting developments has been the <b>adventure playground</b>. We were aware that we <b>had no</b>where for children to let off steam, and <b>decided to use</b> our available funds to <b>set up</b> a <b>completely new</b><b> facility </b>in a large space to the north of the park. It’s open year-round, though it close early in the winter months, and entrance is <b>completely free</b> (Q17/Q18). Children can choose whatever activities they <b>want to do</b>,<b> irrespective </b>of their age, but we <b>do ask</b> adults not to leave them on their own there (Q17/Q18). There are plenty of seats where parents can relax and keep an eye on their children at the <b>same time</b>.","Lastly, the <b>glass houses</b>. A huge amount of <b>work has</b> been done on them to repair the damage following the<b> disastrous </b>fire that recently destroyed their western side (Q19/Q20). Over £80,000 was spent on replacing the glass walls and the metal supports, as well as the plants that had been destroyed, although unfortunately the collection of tropical <b>palm trees</b> <b>has proved</b> <b>too expensive</b> to replace <b>up to now</b>. At present the <b>glass houses</b> are open from 10am to 3pm Mondays to Thursdays, and it’s hoped to extend this to the weekend soon (Q19/Q20). We’re grateful to all those who helped us by contributing their <b>time and money</b> to this achievement.","The <b>gardens have</b> …","#3 <b>Presentation about Refrigeration</b> Transcript","The Part 3 <b>audio <b>transcript of Presentation</b></b> about<b> Refrigeration </b>in Cambridge 15 <b>Listening Test</b> 4 is as follows:","ANNIE:  OK, Jack. Before we plan our <b>presentation about refrigeration</b>, let’s discuss what we’ve discovered so far.","JACK:     Fine, Annie. Though I have to admit I haven’t done much research yet.","ANNIE:  Nor me. But I found an interesting article about icehouses. I’d been some 18th- and 19th-century ones here in the UK, so I knew they were often built in a<b> shady </b>area or underground, close to lakes that might freeze in the winter. But I didn’t realise that<b> insulating </b>the blocks with<b> straw </b>or<b> sawdust </b>meant they didn’t melt for months (Q21). The <b><b>ancient Roman</b>s</b> had refrigeration, too.","JACK:     I didn’t know that.","ANNIE:  Yes,<b> pits </b>were dug in the ground, and snow was imported from the mountains – <b>even though</b> they were at <b>quite a distance</b>. The snow was stored in the pits. Ice formed at the bottom of it. Both the ice and the snow were then sold (Q22). The ice cost more than the snow and my guess is that only the wealthy members of society could afford it.","JACK:     I wouldn’t be surprised. I also <b>came across</b> an article about modern <b>domestic fridges</b>.","ANNIE:  You have to wonder what happens when people <b>get rid</b> of old ones.","JACK:     You mean because the gases in them are harmful for the environment?","ANNIE:  Exactly. At least these are now plenty of organisations that will recycle most of the components safety, but of course some <b>people just</b><b> dump </b>old<b> fridges </b>in the countryside. (Q23)","JACK:     It’s <b>hard to see</b> how they can be stopped unfortunately (Q23). In the UK we <b>get rid</b> of three <b>million a year</b> altogether!","ANNIE:  That sounds a lot, especially because<b> fridges </b><b>hardly ever</b> break down.","JACK:     That’s right. In this country we keep <b>domestic fridges</b> for 11 years on average, and a lot last for 20 or more. So if you divide the cost by the <b>number of years</b> you can use a fridge, they’re not expensive, <b>compared with some</b> household appliances. (Q24)","ANNIE:  True. I suppose manufactures <b>encourage people</b> to spend more by making them different colours and designs. I’m sure when my parents bought their first<b> fridge </b>they had <b>hardly any</b> choice!","JACK:     Yes, there’s been quite a change.","———————–","JACK:     Right, let’s <b>make a list</b> of topics to cover in our presentation, and decide who’s <b>going to do</b> more research on them. Then later, we can get together and plan the <b>next step</b>.","ANNIE:  OK. How about starting with how useful<b> refrigeration </b>is, and the range of goods that are<b> refrigerated </b>(Q25) nowadays? Because of course it’s not just food and drinks.","JACK:     No, I suppose flowers and medicines are refrigerated, too.","ANNIE:  And computers. I could do that (Q26), unless you particularly want to.","JACK:     No, that’s fine by me. What about the effects of<b> refrigeration </b>on people’s health (Q26)? After all, some of the chemicals used in the 19th century were pretty harmful, but there have been <b>lots of benefits</b> too, like <b>always have</b> access to <b>fresh food</b>. Do you fancy dealing with that?","ANNIE:  I’m no<b> terribly </b>keen, to be honest.","JACK:     Nor me. My mind <b>just go</b>es blank when I <b>read any</b>thing about chemicals.","ANNIE:  Oh, <b>all right</b> then, I’ll do you a favour (Q27). But you own me, Jack.","What about the effects on food producers, like farmers in poorer countries being able to export their produce to <b>developed countries</b>? Something for you, maybe?","JACK:     I don’t mind. It should be <b>quite interesting</b>.","ANNIE:  I think we should also look at how<b> refrigeration </b><b>has helped</b> whole cities (Q28) – like <b>Las Vegas</b>, which couldn’t exist without<b> refrigeration </b>because it’s in the middle of a desert.","JACK:     Right. I had a <b>quick look</b> at an economics book in the library that’s got a chapter about this <b>sort of thing</b>. I could give you the title, if you <b>want to do</b> this section.","ANNIE:  Not particularly, to be honest. I find economics books pretty heavy going, as a rule.","JACK:     OK, leave it to me, then.","ANNIE:  Thanks. Then there’s transport, and the difference that<b> refrigerated </b>trucks (Q29) <b>have made</b>. I wouldn’t mind having a go at that.","JACK:     Don’t forget trains, too. I read something about milk and butter being transported in<b> refrigerated </b>railroad cars in the USA, right back in the 1840s.","ANNIE:  I hadn’t thought of trains. Thanks.","JACK:     Shall we have a <b>separate section</b> on <b>domestic fridges</b> (Q30)? After all, they’re something everyone’s familiar with.","ANNIE:  What about splitting it into two? You could investigate 19th- and 20th-century fridges, and I’ll<b> concentrate </b>on what’s available these days, and how manufacturers<b> differentiate </b>their products from those of their competitors.","JACK:     OK, that’d suit me.","#4 How <b><b><b><b>industrial revolution</b> affected</b> life</b> in Britain</b> Transcript","The Part 4 <b>audio script</b> of How <b><b><b><b>industrial revolution</b> affected</b> life</b> in Britain</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 4 is as follows:","Hi everyone, in this session I’ll be presenting my research about the<b> social </b>history of Britain <b><b>during the Industrial</b> Revolution</b>. This was a time that saw the beginning of a new phenomenon;<b> consumerism </b>– where <b>buying and selling</b> goods became a major part of <b>ordinary people</b>’s lives.","In fact, it was in the 19th century that the quantity and quality of people’s possessions was used as an<b> indication </b>of the wealth (Q31) of the country. Before this, the <b>vast majority</b> of <b>people had</b> <b>very few</b> possessions, but all that was changed by the <b>Industrial Revolution</b>. This was the<b> era </b>from the mid-18th to the late 19th century, when improvements in how goods were made as well as in technology (Q32) triggered massive<b> social </b>changes that transformed life for <b>just about everybody</b> in <b>several key</b> areas.","First let’s look at manufacturing. When it comes to manufacturing, we tend to think of the <b>Industrial Revolution</b> in images of steam engines and coal. And it’s true that the <b>Industrial Revolution</b> couldn’t <b>have <b>taken place</b></b> at all if it weren’t for these new <b>sources of power</b> (Q33). They marked an important shift away from the traditional<b> watermills </b>and<b> windmills </b>that had<b> dominated </b>before this. The <b>most advanced</b> industry for much of the 19th century was<b> textiles </b>(Q34).","Before the <b>Industrial Revolution</b>, <b>most people</b> <b>made goods</b> to sell in small workshops, <b>often in their own</b> homes. But enormous new machines (Q35) were now being created that could produce the goods faster and on a larger scale, and these required a lot more space. So large factories were built, replacing the workshops, and forcing workers to <b>travel to work</b>. In fact, <b><b>large number</b>s</b> of people migrated from villages into towns as a result.","———————–","As well as manufacturing, there were <b>new technologies</b> in transport, contributing to the growth of consumerism. The horse-drawn<b> stagecoaches </b>and carts of the 18th century, which carried very <b>few people</b> and good, and travelled slowly along poorly surfaced roads, were <b>gradually replaced</b> by the<b> numerous </b>canals that were constructed. These were <b>particularly important</b> for the transportation of goods.","The canals gradually <b>fell out of use</b>, though, as railways were developed, becoming the <b>main way</b> of moving goods and people from <b>one end</b> of the country to the other. And the goods they moved weren’t just coal, iron, clothes, and so on – significantly, they included newspapers (Q36), which meant that <b>thousands of people</b> were not only more<b> knowledgeable </b>about what was going on in the country, but could <b>also read</b> about what was available in the shops. And that encouraged them to buy more. so faster forms of transport resulted in distribution becoming far more efficient – goods could now be sold all over the country, <b>instead of just</b> in the local (Q37) market.","The third main area that saw changes that contributed to<b> consumerism </b>was retailing. The number and quality of shops grew rapidly, and in particular, small shops suffered as customers<b> flocked </b>to the <b>growing number</b> of <b>department stores</b> – a form of retailing that was new in the 19th century. The<b> entrepreneurs </b>who opened these found <b>new ways</b> to stock them with goods, and to attract customers: for instance, improved lighting (Q38) inside greatly increased the visibility of the goods for sale. Another development that <b>made goods</b> more visible from outside resulted from the use of plate glass, which <b>made it possible</b> for windows (Q39) to be <b>much larger</b> than previously. <b>New ways</b> of promoting goods were introduced, too. Previously, the focus had been on informing <b>potential customers</b> about the availability of goods; now there was an<b> explosion </b>in advertising (Q40) trying to <b>persuade people</b> to go shopping.","Flanders claims that <b>one of the great</b> effects of the <b>Industrial Revolution</b> was that it created choice. <b>All sorts</b> of things that had previously been luxuries – from sugar to<b> cutlery </b>– became conveniences, and before long they’d turned into necessities: life without sugar or<b> cutlery </b>was unimaginable. <b>Rather like</b> <b>mobile phones</b> these days!"]},{"name":"ALS/16-1","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Children’s Engineering Workshops Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of Children’s <b>Engineering Workshops</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 1 is as follows:","SARAH:     Hello.

I wanted <b>some information</b> about the workshops in the school holidays.","SARAH:     Sure.","FATHER:     I <b>have two</b> daughters who are interested. The younger one’s Lydia, she’s four – <b>do you take</b> children as young as that?","SARAH:     Yes, our <b>Tiny Engineers</b> workshop is for four to five-year-olds.","FATHER:     What <b>sorts of activities</b> <b>do they do</b>?","SARAH:     <b>All sorts</b>. For example, they <b>work together</b> to design a special cover that <b>goes round</b> an egg (Q1), so that when it’s inside they can drop it from a height and it doesn’t break. Well, sometimes it does break but that’s part of the fun!","FATHER:     Right. And Lydia loves building things. Is there any opportunity for her to do that?","SARAH:     Well, they <b>have a competition</b> to see who can make the highest tower (Q2). You’d be amazed how high they can go.","FATHER:     Right.","SARAH:     But they’re learning <b>all the time</b> as <b>well as having</b> fun. For example, <b>one thing</b> they do is to design and build a car (Q3) that’s attached to a balloon, and the force of the air in that actually powers the car and makes it move along.

That’s for children from six to eight.","FATHER:     And do they <b>do the same</b> <b>sorts of activities</b>?","SARAH:     Some are the same, but a bit more advanced. So they work out how to build model vehicles, <b>things like</b> cars and trucks, but also how to construct animals (Q4) <b>using the same</b> sorts of material and technique, and then they learn how they can program them and make them move.","FATHER:     So they learn a bit of coding?","SARAH:     They do. They pick it up <b>really quickly</b>. We’re there to help if they need it, but they learn from <b>one another</b> too.","FATHER:     Right. And <b>do they have</b> competition too?","SARAH:     Yes, with the Junior Engineers, it’s to use<b> recycled </b><b>materials like</b> card and wood to build a bridge (Q5), and the longest one gets a prize.","FATHER:     That sounds fun. I wouldn’t mind doing that myself!","SARAH:     Then they <b><b>have some</b>thing</b> a bit different, which is to think up an idea for a five-minute movie (Q6) and then film it, using special animation software. You’d be amazed what they <b>come up</b> with.","FATHER:     And of course, that’s something they can put on their phone and <b>take home</b> to show all their friends.","SARAH:     Exactly. And then they also build a robot in the shape of a human, and they decorate (Q7) it and program it so that it can move its arms and legs.","FATHER:     Perfect.

Thank you for choosing us for your <b>two weeks</b> of <b>work experience</b>. My name is Julia Simmons, and <b>since the beginning</b> of this year I’ve been the managing director.","Stevenson’s is quite an old company. <b>Like me</b>, the founder, Ronald Stevenson, went into the<b> steel </b>industry when he <b>left school</b> – that was in 1923. He <b>set up</b> this company when he finished his apprenticeship, in 1926 (Q11), although he actually started making plans <b>two years</b> earlier, in 1924. He was a very determined <b>young man</b>!","Stevenson’s long-term plan was to manufacture components for the machine tools industry – although in fact that never came about – and for the automotive industry, that is, <b>cars and lorries</b>. However, there was a delay of <b>five years</b> before that happened, because shortly before the company went into production, Stevenson was <b>given the opportunity</b> to make goods for hospitals and other players in the healthcare industry, so that’s what we did for the first <b>five years</b> (Q12).","Over the years, we’ve expanded the premises considerably – we were lucky that the site is <b>big enough</b>, so <b>moving to a new</b> location <b>has never</b> been necessary (Q13). However, the layout is far from ideal for modern<b> machinery </b>and production methods, so we intend to carry out <b>major refurbishment</b> of this site (Q13) over the next <b>five years</b>.","I’d better <b><b>give you some</b> idea</b> of what you’ll be doing during your <b>two weeks</b> with us, so you know what to expect. Most mornings you’ll have a presentation from one of the managers (Q14), to learn about their department, starting this morning with research and development. And you’ll all <b>spend some</b> <b>time in each</b> department, observing what’s going on and talking to people – as long as you don’t stop them from doing their <b>work altogether</b>! In the past, a teacher from your <b>school has</b> come in at the <b>end of each</b> week to find out how the group were getting on, but your school isn’t able to arrange that this year.","————————-","OK, now I’ll briefly help you to<b> orientate </b>yourselves around the site. As you can see, we’re in the reception area, which we <b>try to make</b> attractive and welcoming to visitors. There’s a corridor <b>running left</b> from here, and if you go along that, the door facing you at the end is the entrance to the coffee room. This <b><b>looks out onto the main</b> road</b> on <b>one side</b>, and <b>some trees</b> on the other (Q15), and that’ll be where you meet <b>each morning</b>.","The factory is the very big room on the <b>far side</b> of the site. Next to it is the warehouse, which can be accessed by<b> lorries </b>going up the road to the turning area at the end. You can get to the warehouse by crossing to the <b>far side</b> of the courtyard, and then the door is on your right (Q16).","Somewhere you’ll be keen to find is the staff canteen. This is <b>right next</b> to reception (Q17). I can confidently say that the food’s <b>very good</b>, but the view isn’t. The windows on <b>one side</b> look onto a corridor and courtyard, which aren’t <b>very attractive</b> at all, and on the other onto the access road, which isn’t <b>much better</b>.","You’ll be using the <b>meeting room</b> quite often, and you’ll find it by walking along the corridor to the left of the courtyard, and continuing along it to the end. The <b>meeting room</b> is the last one on the right (Q18), and I’m afraid there’s <b>no natural</b> daylight in the room.","Then you’ll <b>need to know</b> where some of the offices are. The <b>human <b>resources department</b></b> is all the front of this building, so you head to the left along the corridor from reception, and it’s the second <b>room you come</b> to. It <b><b>looks out onto the main</b> road</b> (Q19).","And finally, the boardroom (Q20), where you’ll be meeting sometimes. That <b>has quite</b> a pleasant view, as it looks out on to the trees. Go along the corridor past the courtyard, right to the end. The boardroom is on the left, next to the factory.","OK, now are there <b>any questions</b> before we …","#3 Part 3 <b>Listening Test</b> 1 Transcript","The Part 3 <b>audio <b>transcript in Cambridge</b></b> 16 <b>Listening Test</b> 1 is as follows:","JESS:     How are you getting on with your art project, Tom?","TOM:     OK. Like, they gave us the theme of birds to base our project on, and I’m not <b>really all</b> that interested in wildlife. But I’m starting to get into it. I’ve <b>pretty well</b> finished the<b> introductory </b>stage.","JESS:     So have I. When they gave us all those handouts with details of books and websites to look at (Q21/Q22), I was really put off, but the more I read, the more interested I got.","TOM:     <b>Me too</b>. I found I could research so many <b>different aspects</b> of birds in art – colour, movement, texture. So I was <b>looking forward</b> to the Bird Park visit.","JESS:     What a letdown! It<b> poured </b>with rain and we hardly saw a single bird. <b>Much less</b> use than the trip to the <b>Natural History</b> Museum (Q21/Q22).","TOM:     Yeah, I liked all the stuff about evolution there. The workshop sessions with Dr Fletcher were good too, especially the brainstorming sessions.","JESS:     I missed those because I was ill. I wish we could’ve seen the projects <b>last year</b>’s <b>students did</b>.","TOM:     Mm. I suppose they want us to do our own thing, not copy.","JESS:     Have you drafted your proposal yet?","TOM:     Yes, but I haven’t handed it in. I need to amend some parts. I’ve realised the notes from my research are <b>almost all</b> just descriptions, I haven’t actually evaluated anything. So I’ll have to fix that (Q23/Q24).","JESS:     Oh, I didn’t know we <b>had to do</b> that. I’ll have to <b>look at that too</b>. Did you do a timeline for the project?","TOM:     Yes, and a mind map.","JESS:     Yeah, so did I. I quite enjoyed that. But it was hard having to explain the basis for my decisions in my <b>action plan</b>.","TOM:     What?","JESS:     You know, give a rationale.","TOM:     I didn’t realise we <b>had to do</b> that. OK, I can add it now. And I’ve done the video diary presentation, and worked out what I want my outcome to be in the project.","JESS:     <b><b>Someone told</b> me</b> it’s best not to be too precise about your actual outcome (Q23/Q24) at this stage, so you have more scope to explore your ideas later on. So I’m <b>going to do</b> back to my proposal to make it a bit more vague.","TOM:     Really? OK, I’ll change that too then.","——————————","TOM:     <b>One part</b> of the project, I’m unsure about is where we choose <b>some painting</b>s of birds and say what they mean to us. Like, I chose a painting of a falcon by Landseer. I like it because the bird’s standing there with his head turned to <b>one side</b>, but he seems to be staring<b> straight </b>at you. But I can’t just say it’s a bit scary, can I?","JESS:     You could talk about the possible danger suggested by the bird’s look (Q25).","TOM:     Oh, OK.","JESS:     There’s a picture of a fish<b> hawk </b>by Audubon I like. It’s<b> swooping </b>over the water with a fish in its talons, and with <b>great black</b> wings which <b>take up</b> most of the picture.","TOM:     So you could discuss it in relation to predators and food chains?","JESS:     Well actually I think I’ll<b> concentrate </b>on the impression of rapid motion it gives. (Q26)","TOM:     Right.","JESS:     <b>Do you know</b> that picture of a<b> kingfisher </b>by van Gosh – it’s<b> perching </b>on a<b> reed </b>growing near a stream.","TOM:     Yes, it’s got these beautiful blue and red and black shades.","JESS:     Mm hm. I’ve actually chosen it because I saw a real<b> kingfisher </b>once when I was litter, I was out walking with my grandfather (Q27), and I’ve <b>never forgotten</b> it.","TOM:     So we can use a personal link?","JESS:     Sure.","TOM:     OK. There’s a<b> portrait </b>called William Wells. I can’t remember the artist but it’s a middle-aged man who’s just shot a bird. And his expression, and the way he’s holding the bird in his hand suggests he’s not sure about what he’s done. To me it’s about how<b> ambiguous </b>people are in the way they<b> exploit </b>the <b>natural world</b>. (Q28)","JESS:     Interesting. There’s Gauguin’s picture Vairumati. He did it in Tahiti. It’s a woman with a white bird behind her that is eating a lizard, and what I’m interested in is what idea this bird<b> refers </b>to. Apparently, it’s a<b> reference </b>to the never-ending cycle of existence. (Q29)","TOM:     Wow. I chose a<b> portrait </b>of a little boy, Giovanni de Medici. He’s holding a tiny bird in one fist (Q30). I like the way he’s holding it carefully so he doesn’t hurt it.","JESS:     Ah right.","#4 Stoicism Answers","The Part 4 <b>audio script</b> of Stoicism in <b>Listening Test</b> 1 is as follows:","Ancient<b> philosophy </b>is not just about talking or lecturing, or even reading long, dense books. In fact, it is <b>something people</b> <b>have used</b> throughout history – to solve their problems and to achieve their greatest triumphs.","Specifically, I am<b> referring </b>to Stoicism, which, in my opinion, is the <b>most practical</b> of all<b> philosophies </b>(Q31) and therefore the most appealing.","Stoicism was founded in Ancient Greece by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BC, but was practised by the likes of Epictetus, Cato.","Seneca and <b>Marcus Aurelius</b>. Amazingly, we still <b>have access</b> to these ideas, <b>despite the fact</b> that the <b>most famous</b> Stoics never wrote anything down for publication (Q32). Cato definitely didn’t.","<b>Marcus Aurelius</b> <b>never intended</b> his Meditations to be anything but personal. Seneca’s letters were, well, letters and Epictetus’ thoughts come to us by way of a note-taking student.","<b>Stoic principles</b> were based on the idea that its followers could have an<b> unshakable </b>happiness in this life and the key to achieving this was virtue. The road to virtue, in turn, lay in understanding that destructive emotions, like anger and jealousy, are under our<b> conscious </b>control – they don’t have to control us, because we can <b>learn to control</b> them.","In the words of Epictetus: “external events I cannot control, but the choices I make with regard to them, I do control”. (Q33)","The modern day<b> philosopher </b>and writer Nassim Nicholas Taleb defines a Stoic as <b>someone who has</b> a different<b> perspective </b>on experience which most of us would see as wholly negative (Q34); a Stoic “transforms fear into caution, pain into transformation, mistakes into initiation and desire into undertaking”.","Using this definition as a model, we can see that throughout the centuries <b>Stoicism has</b> been practised in more recent history by kings, presidents, artists, writers and entrepreneurs.","The founding fathers of the <b>United States</b> were inspired by the philosophy. George Washington was introduced to Stoicism by his neighbours at age seventeen, and later, put on a play based on the life of Cato to inspire his men (Q35). Thomas Jefferson kept a copy of Seneca beside his bed.","Writers and artists <b>have also</b> been inspired by the stoics. Eugène Delacroix, the <b>renowned French</b><b> Romantic </b>artist (known best for his painting Liberty Leading the People) was an<b> ardent </b>Stoic,<b> referring </b>to it as his “consoling religion”.","The economist Adam Smith’s theories on<b> capitalism </b>were significantly influenced by the Stoicism (Q36) that he studied as a schoolboy, under a teacher who had translated <b>Marcus Aurelius</b>’ works.","Today’s political leaders are no different, with many finding their<b> inspiration </b>from the ancient texts. Former US president Bill Clinton<b> rereads </b><b>Marcus Aurelius</b> <b>every single</b> year, and <b>many have</b> compared former President Obama’s calm leadership style to that of Cato.","Wen Jiabao, the former prime minister of China, claims that Meditations is one of two books he travels with and that he has read it more than <b>one hundred</b> times over the course of his life.","Stoicism had a profound influence on Albert Ellis, who invented Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (Q37), which is used to help <b>people manage</b> their problems by changing the way that they think and behave.","It’s most commonly <b>used to treat</b> depression. The idea is that we can take control of our lives by challenging the<b> irrational </b>belief that create our faulty thinking,<b> symptoms </b>and behaviours by using logic instead. (Q38)","<b>Stoicism has</b> also become popular in the world of business. <b>Stoic principles</b> can build the<b> resilience </b>and state of mind required to overcome<b> setbacks </b>because Stoics teach turning obstacles into opportunity (Q39).

I’d <b>like to <b><b>bring you up</b> to date</b></b> with changes in the school that will affect your children.","As you know, the <b>school buildings</b> date from various times: some from the 1970s, some from the last <b>five years</b>, and of course Dartfield House is over a century old. It was<b> commissioned </b>by a businessman. Neville Richards, and intended as his family home, but he died before it was completed.","His heir chose to sell it to the <b>local council</b>, who turned it into offices (Q11). A later plan to convert it into a <b>tourist information</b> centre didn’t come about, through lack of money, and instead it formed the<b> nucleus </b>of this school when it opened 40 <b>years ago</b>.","The <b>school has</b> grown as the <b>local population</b> <b>has increased</b>, and I can now <b>give you some</b> news about the <b>lower school</b> site, which is<b> separated </b>from the <b>main site</b> by a road. Planning permission has been granted for development of both sites.","The <b>lower school</b> will move to <b><b>new building</b>s</b> that will be constructed on the <b>main site</b>. Developers will construct houses on the existing <b>lower school</b> site (Q12). Work on the new <b>school buildings</b> should start within the next <b>few months</b>.","<b>A </b> more<b> imminent </b>change concerns the catering<b> facilities </b>and the canteen. The<b> canteen </b>is <b>always very</b> busy throughout the lunch period – in fact it’s often full to capacity, <b>because a lot</b> of our pupils like the food that’s on offer there.","But there’s <b>only one</b> <b>serving point</b>, so most pupils <b>have to wait</b> a considerable time to be served (Q13). This is obviously unsatisfactory, as they may have <b>hardly finished</b> their lunch before afternoon lessons start.","So we’ve had a <b>new <b>Food Hall</b></b> built, and this will come into use <b>next week</b>. It’ll <b>have several</b> serving areas, and I’ll give you more details about those in a minute, but <b>one thing</b> we ask you to do, to help in the smooth running of the <b>Food Hall</b>, is to discuss with your children <b>each morning</b> which type of food they want to eat that day (Q14), so they can <b>go straight</b> to the<b> relevant </b><b>serving point</b>.","There won’t be any junk food – everything on offer will be healthy – and there’s no change to the current system of paying for lunches by topping up your child’s<b> electronic </b>payment card online.","You may be wondering what will happen to the old canteen. We’ll <b>still have</b> <b>tables and chairs</b> in there, and pupils can <b>eat food</b> from the <b>Food Hall</b> or lunch they’ve brought from home (Q15). Eventually we may use part of the<b> canteen </b>for storage, but first we’ll <b>see how many</b> pupils go in there at lunchtime.","————————-","OK, back to the <b>serving point</b>s in the <b>Food Hall</b>, which will <b>all have</b> side dishes, desserts and drinks on sale, as well as main courses.","One <b>serving point</b> we call World Adventures (Q16). This will serve a different country’s<b> cuisine </b><b>each day</b>, maybe Chinese <b>one day</b> and Lebanese the next. The menus will be planned for a week at a time, so pupils will know what’s going to be available the whole of the week.","Street Life is also international, with food from three particular cultures. We’ll ask pupils to <b>make suggestions</b> (Q17), so perhaps sometimes there’ll be food from Thailand, Ethiopia and Mexico, and then one of them will be replaced by Jamaican food for a <b>week or two</b>.","The Speedy Italian <b>serving point</b> will cater particularly for the <b>many pupils</b> who don’t <b>eat meat</b> or fish (Q18): they can be sure that <b>all the food</b> served there is suitable for them. There’ll be plenty of variety, so they shouldn’t <b>get bored</b> with the food.","OK, that’s all on the <b>new <b>Food Hall</b></b>. Now after-school lessons. There are <b>very popular</b> with pupils, particularly swimming – in fact there’s a <b>waiting list</b> for lessons. Cycling is another favourite, and I’m delighted that dozens of pupils <b>make use</b> of the chance to learn to ride in off-road conditions.","It means that more and more cycle to and from school <b>every day</b>. As you know, we have a well-equipped performance centre, and we’re <b>going to start</b> drama classes (Q19/Q20) in there, too. <b>Pupils will be able</b> to join in just for fun or <b>work up</b> to <b>taking part</b> in a play – we hope to put on at <b>least one</b> a year. We already teach a number of pupils to use the sound and lighting systems in the centre.","And a former pupil <b>has given</b> a magnificent grand piano to the school, so a few <b>pupils will be able</b> to learn at the school <b>instead of going</b> to the local college, as many of them do at the moment.","#3 <b><b>Assignment on sleep</b> and dreams</b> Transcript","The Part 3 <b>audio script</b> of <b><b>Assignment on sleep</b> and dreams</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 2 is as follows:","SUSIE:     So Luke, for our next<b> psychology </b>assignment we have to <b><b>do some</b>thing</b> on <b>sleep and dreams</b>.","LUKE:      Right. I’ve just <b>read an article</b> suggesting why we tend to forget most of our dreams soon after we <b>wake up</b>. I mean, most of my dreams aren’t that interesting anyway, but what it said was that if we remembered everything, we might get mixed up about what actually happened and what we dreamed (Q21). So it’s a sort of protection. I hadn’t heard that idea before. I’d always assumed that it was just that we didn’t have room in our memories for all that stuff.","SUSIE:     <b>Me too</b>. What <b>do you think</b> about the idea that our dreams may <b>predict the future</b>?","LUKE:      It’s a belief that you get <b>all over the world</b>.","SUSIE:     Yeah, <b>lots of people</b> have a story of it happening to them, but the explanation I’ve read is that for each dream that comes true, we have thousands that don’t (Q22), but we don’t notice those, we don’t even remember them. We just remember the ones where something in the real world, like a view or an action, happens to trigger a dream memory.","LUKE:      Right. So it’s just a<b> coincidence </b>really. Something else I read about is what they call<b> segmented </b>sleeping. That’s a theory that <b>hundreds of years</b> ago, <b><b>people use</b>d</b> to <b>get up</b> in the middle of the night and have a chat or something to eat, then <b>go back</b> to bed. So I tried it myself.","SUSIE:     Why?","LUKE:      Well it’s meant to make you more creative. I don’t know why. But I gave it up after a week. It just didn’t fit in with my lifestyle.","SUSIE:     But most pre-school <b>children have</b> a short sleep in the day don’t they? There was an experiment <b>some students</b> did here last term to see at what age kids should stop having naps. But they didn’t really find an answer (Q23). They spent a lot of <b>time working</b> out the <b>most appropriate</b> methodology, but the results didn’t <b><b>seem to show</b> any</b> obvious patterns.","LUKE:      Right. Anyway, let’s think about our assignment. <b>Last time</b> I <b>had problems</b> with the <b>final stage</b>, where we had to describe and justify how successful we thought we’d been (Q24). I struggled a bit with the <b>action plan</b> too.","SUSIE:     I was OK with the planning, but I got <b>marked down</b> for the self-assessment as well. And I had big problems with the<b> statistical </b>stuff, that’s where I really lost marks.","LUKE:      Right.","————————–","SUSIE:     So shall we plan what we <b>have to do</b> for this assignment?","LUKE:      OK.","SUSIE:     First, we <b>have to decide</b> on our research question. So how about ‘Is there a relationship between hours of sleep and <b>number of dreams</b>?’","LUKE:      OK. Then we <b>need to think</b> about who we’ll do they study on. About 12 people?","SUSIE:     Right. And shall we <b>use other</b><b> psychology </b>students?","LUKE:      Let’s use people from a different department. What about history? (Q25)","SUSIE:     Yes, they might have interesting dreams! Or literature students?","LUKE:      I don’t <b>really know</b> any.","SUSIE:     OK, forget that idea. Then we have to think about our methodology. So we could use observation, but that doesn’t seem appropriate.","LUKE:      No. it needs to be self-reporting I think. And we could ask them to <b>answer questions</b> online.","SUSIE:     But in this case, paper might be better (Q26) as they’ll be doing it<b> straight </b>after they <b>wake up</b> … in fact while they’re still half-asleep.","LUKE:      Right. And we’ll have to check the<b> ethical </b>guidelines (Q27) for this sort of research.","SUSIE:     Mm, because our experiment involves humans, so there are special regulations.","LUKE:      Yes, I <b>had a look</b> at those for another assignment I did. There’s a whole section on <b>risk assessment</b>, and another section on <b>making sure</b> they aren’t put under any unnecessary stress. (Q28)","SUSIE:     Let’s hope they don’t <b>have any</b> bad dreams!","LUKE:      Yeah.","SUSIE:     Then when we’ve collected all our data we <b>have to analyse</b> it and calculate the correlation between our two variables, that’s time sleeping and <b>number of dreams</b> and then present our results visually in a graph. (Q29)","LUKE:      Right. And the <b>final thing</b> is to think about our research and evaluate it (Q30). So that seems <b>quite straightforward</b>.","SUSIE:     Yeah. So <b>now let</b>’s …","#4 <b>Health <b>benefits of dance</b></b> Transcript","The Part 4 <b>audio script</b> of <b>Health <b>benefits of dance</b></b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 2 is as follows:","Dancing is something that humans do when they <b><b>want to have</b> a good</b> time. It’s a universal response to music, found in all cultures. But what’s only been discovered recently is that dancing not only <b><b>makes us feel</b> good</b>, it’s also extremely good for our health.","Dancing, like <b>other forms</b> of exercise, releases hormones, such as dopamine, which <b>make us feel</b> relaxed and happy. And it <b>also reduces</b> feelings of stress or anxiety.","Dancing is also a<b> sociable </b>activity, which is <b>another reason</b> it <b><b>makes us feel</b> good</b>.","<b>One study</b> compared people’s enjoyment of dancing at home in front of a video with <b>dancing in a group</b> in a studio.","The people <b>dancing in a group</b> reported feeling happier, whereas those dancing alone did not.","In another experiment, university researchers at York and Sheffield took a group of students and sent each of them into a lab where music was played for <b>five minutes</b>. <b>Each had</b> to choose from three options: to sit and listen quietly to the music, to cycle on an exercise bike while they listened, or to <b>get up</b> and dance.","All were given <b>cognitive tasks</b> to perform before and after. The result showed that those who chose to dance showed much more creativity (Q31) when doing problem-solving tasks.","Doctor Lovatt at the University of Hertfordshire believes dance could be a very <b>useful way</b> to <b>help people</b> suffering from mental <b>health problems</b>. He thinks dance should be<b> prescribed </b>ad therapy (Q32) to <b>help people</b> overcome <b>issues such</b> as depression.","————————","It’s <b>well established</b> that dance is a <b>good way</b> of encouraging adolescent girls to take exercise but what about <b>older people</b>? <b><b>Studies have</b> shown</b> that there are enormous benefits for people in their sixties and beyond.","<b><b>One of the great</b> things</b> about dance is that there are no barriers to participation. Anyone can <b>have a go</b>, even those whose standard of fitness is quite low. (Q33)","Dance can be especially beneficial for older adults who can’t run or do more intense workouts, or for those who don’t want to. One 2015 study <b>found that even</b> a gently dance workout helps to promote a healthy heart.","And there’s <b>plenty of evidence</b> which suggests that dancing lowers the risk of falls, which could result in a broken hip, for example, by helping <b>people to improve</b> their balance. (Q34)","T<b>here are some</b> <b>less obvious</b> <b>benefits of dance</b> for <b>older people</b> too. <b>One thing</b> I hadn’t realised before researching this topic was that dance isn’t just a <b>physical challenge</b>.","It also requires a lot of<b> concentration </b>because you need to remember <b>different steps</b> and routines. For <b>older people</b>, this kind of activity is especially <b>important because</b> it forces their brain to process things more quickly (Q35) and to retain more information.","Current <b><b>research also</b> shows</b> that dance promotes a general sense of well-being in older participants, which can last up to a week after a class. Participants report feeling less tired and having greater motivation to be more active (Q36) and do daily <b>activities such</b> as gardening or walking to the shops or a park.","Ballroom or country dancing, both popular with <b>older people</b>. They require collaboration and <b>often involve</b> touching a dance partner, all of which encourages interaction on the dance floor.","This helps to <b>develop new</b> relationships and can reduce <b>older people</b>’s sense of isolation (Q37), which is a <b>huge problem</b> in <b>many countries</b>.","<b>I </b> also looked at the benefits of Zumba. Fifteen <b>million people</b> in 180 countries now regularly take a Zumba class, an aerobic workout based on <b>Latin American</b> dance moves.","John Porcari, a professor of exercise and sport science at the University of Wisconsin, analysed a group of women who were Zumba regulars and found that a class lasting 40 minutes burns about 370 calories. This is similar to moderately intense exercises (Q38) like step aerobics or kickboxing.","<b>A </b> study in the American Journal of Health Behavior showed that when women with<b> obesity </b>(Q39) did Zumba three <b>times a week</b> for 16 weeks, they lost an average of 1.2<b> kilos </b>and lowered their percentage of body fat by 1%. More importantly, the women enjoyed the class so much that they made it a habit (Q40) and continued to <b>attend classes</b> at least <b>once a week</b> – very<b> unusual </b>for an <b>aerobic exercise</b> programme.","Dance is <b>never going</b> to compete with high-intensity workouts when it comes to <b>physical fitness</b> gains, but its<b> popularity </b>is likely to keep on rising because it’s such a fun <b>way to keep</b> fit."]},{"name":"ALS/16-3","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Junior cycle camp Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of <b><b>Junior cycle</b> camp</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 3 is as follows:","JAKE:            Hello, <b><b>Junior Cycle</b> camp</b>, Jake speaking.","WOMAN:     Hi.

It was hard to <b>keep track</b> of it all, especially as I had so <b>many people</b> doing it (Q21/Q22) – I <b>had to make</b> sure I kept a proper record of what <b>each person</b> <b>had had</b>.","ROSIE:      So could <b>most people</b> <b>tell the difference</b>?","ADAM:     Yeah – I hadn’t thought they would be able to, but <b>most people</b> could.","ROSIE:      Then there’s that <b>experiment I did</b> measuring the <b>fat content</b> of nuts, to see if the<b> nutritional </b>information given on the packet was accurate.","ADAM:     The one where you <b>ground <b>up the nuts</b></b> and mixed them with a chemical to absorb the fat?","ROSIE:      Yes. My results were a bit<b> problematic </b>– the <b>fat content</b> for that type of nut seemed much lower than it said on the package. But I reckon the package information was right. I think I should <b>probably have</b> <b>ground <b>up the nuts</b></b> more than I did. It’s possible that the scales for weighing the fat weren’t accurate enough (Q23/Q24), too. I’d <b>really like</b> to try the experiment again <b>some time</b>.","———————-","ADAM:     So what can we say about <b>helping people</b> to <b>lose weight</b>? There’s a lot we could say about what restaurants could do to reduce obesity. I read that the items at the start of a menu and the items at the end of a menu. They are much more likely to be chosen than the items in the middle. So, if you put the low-calorie items at the <b>beginning and end</b> of the menu, people will probably go for the food with fewer calories (Q25), without even realising what they’re doing.","ROSIE:      I think <b>food manufacturers</b> could do more to <b><b>encourage healthy</b> eating</b>.","ADAM:     How?","ROSIE:      Well, when manufacturers put calorie counts of a food on the label, they’re sometimes really confusing and I<b> suspect </b>they do it on purpose (Q26). Because food that’s <b>high in calories</b> tastes better, and so they’ll sell more.","ADAM:     Yeah, so if you look at the amount of calories in a pizza, they’ll give you the calories per <b>quarter pizza</b> and you think, oh that’s not <b>too bad</b>. But who’s going to eat a <b>quarter pizza</b>?","ROSIE:      Exactly.","ADAM:     I suppose another approach to this problem is to <b>get people</b> to exercise more.","ROSIE:      Right. In England, the current guidelines are for at least 30 minutes of<b> brisk </b>walking, five <b>days a week</b>. Now when you ask them, about 40% of men and 30% of women say they do this, but when you objectively measure the amount of walking they do with motion sensors, you find that only 6% of men and 4% of women do the recommended amount of exercise. (Q27)","ADAM:     Mm, so you can see why<b> obesity </b>is growing.","ROSIE:      So how can people encourage to take more exercise?","ADAM:     Well, for example, think of the location of stairs station. if people reach the stairs before they reach the escalator when they’re leaving the station, they’re more likely to take the stairs. And if you increase the width of the stairs, you’ll <b>get more people</b> using them at the <b>same time</b> (Q28). It’s an<b> unconscious </b>process and influenced by minor modifications in their environment.","ROSIE:      Right. And it might not be a big change, but if it happens <b>every day</b>, it all adds up.","ADAM:     Yes. But actually, I’m not sure if we should be talking about exercise in our presentation. (Q29)","ROSIE:      Well, we’ve done <b>quite a bit</b> of reading about it.","ADAM:     I know, but it’s going to mean we <b>have a very</b> wide focus, and our tutor did say that we <b>need to focus</b> on causes and solutions in terms of nutrition.","ROSIE:      I suppose so. And we’ve got <b>plenty of information</b> about that. OK, well that will be simpler.","ADAM:     So what shall we <b>do now</b>? We’ve <b>still got</b> half an hour before our next lecture.","ROSIE:      Let’s think about what we’re going to include and what will go where (Q30). Then we can decide what slides we need.","ADAM:     OK, fine.","#4 <b>Hand Knitting</b> Transcript","The Part 4 <b>audio script</b> of <b>Hand Knitting</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 3 is as follows:","<b>Good <b>morning everyone</b></b>. So today we’re <b>going to <b>look at an important</b></b> creative activity and that’s <b>hand knitting</b>. Ancient <b>knitted garments</b> <b>have been found</b> in many <b>different countries</b>. Showing that<b> knitting </b>is a global activity with a long history.","When someone says the word ‘knitting’ we might well picture an elderly person – a grandmother perhaps – sitting by the fire<b> knitting </b>(Q31) garments for themselves or other <b>members of the family</b>. It’s a homely image, but one that may lead you to feel that<b> knitting </b>is an activity of the past – and, indeed, during the previous decade, it was one of the skills that was predicted to<b> vanish </b>(Q32) from <b>everyday life</b>.","For although <b>humans have</b><b> sewn </b>and<b> knitted </b>their own clothing for a very <b>long time</b>, many of these craft-based skills went into decline when<b> industrial </b>machines took over – mainly because they were <b>no longer</b> <b>passed down</b> from <b>one generation</b> to another.","However, that’s all changing and interest in<b> knitting </b>classes in <b>many countries</b> is actually rising, as more and more people are seeking formal instruction in the skill. With that trend, we’re <b>also see</b>ing an increase in the <b>sales figures</b> for<b> knitting </b>equipment. (Q34)","So why <b>do <b>people want</b></b> to be taught to knit at a time when a machine can readily <b>do the job</b> for them? The answer is that knitting, as a handicraft, <b>has numerous</b> benefits for those doing it. Let’s consider what some of these might be.","While <b>many people</b> <b>knitted garments</b> in the <b>past because</b> they couldn’t <b>afford to buy</b> clothes, it’s still true today that<b> knitting </b>can be helpful if you’re experiencing economic hardship (Q34). If you <b>have several</b> children who all need <b>warm winter</b> clothes,<b> knitting </b>may save you a <b>lot of money</b>.","And the results of<b> knitting </b>your own clothes can be very rewarding, <b>even though</b> the skills you <b><b>need to get</b> going</b> are really quite basic (Q35) and the financial<b> outlay </b>is minimal.","But the more significant benefits in today’s world are to do with well-being. In a world where it’s<b> estimated </b>that we sp<b>end up</b> to nine hours a day online, <b><b>doing some</b>thing</b> with our hands that is craft-based <b><b>makes us feel</b> good</b>. It releases us from the stress of a technological, fast-paced life.","———————","Now, let’s <b>look back</b> a bit <b>too early</b><b> knitting </b>activities. In fact, <b>no <b>one <b><b>really know</b>s</b></b></b> when<b> knitting </b>first began. But archaeological remains have<b> disclosed </b><b>plenty of information</b> for us to think about.","One of the interesting things about<b> knitting </b>is that the earliest pieces of <b>clothing that have</b> been found <b>suggest that most</b> of the items produced were round (Q36) rather than flat. Discoveries from the 3rd and 4th centuries in Egypt show that <b>things like</b> socks and gloves, that were <b>needed to keep</b> hands and feet warm, were<b> knitted </b>in one piece using <b>four or five</b> needles.","That’s very <b>different from most</b><b> knitting </b>patterns today, which only require two. What’s more, the very <b>first need</b>les <b><b>people use</b>d</b> were hand carved out of wood and other natural materials, like bone (Q37), whereas today’s needles are largely made of<b> steel </b>or plastic and make that characteristic clicking sound when someone’s using them. <b>Ancient people</b><b> knitted </b>using yarns made from linen, hemp, <b>cotton and wool</b>, and these were often very rough on the skin (Q38).","The<b> spinning </b>wheel, which <b>allowed people</b> to make finer yarns and produce <b>much greater</b> quantities of them, led to the<b> dominance </b>of<b> wool </b>in the<b> knitting </b>industry – often favoured for its warmth.","Another interesting fact about<b> knitting </b>is that because it was practised in so <b>many <b>parts of the world</b></b> for so many purposes, regional differences in style developed (Q39). This visual identity has <b>allowed researchers</b> to match bits of<b> knitted </b><b>clothing that have</b> been<b> unearthed </b>over time to the region from which the wearer came or the job that he or she did.","As I’ve mentioned,<b> knitting </b>offered people from poor communities a <b>way of making</b> extra money while doing other tasks. For <b>many centuries</b>, it seems, men, women and children took every opportunity to knit, for example, while watching over sheep (Q40), walking to market or riding in boats. So, let’s move on to take a …"]},{"name":"ALS/16-4","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Holiday rental Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of <b>Holiday rental</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 4 is as follows:","SHIRLEY:     Hello?","TOM:           <b>Oh hello</b>.

It’s free the <b>week beginning</b> the 28th (Q1), though, for seven nights. In fact, that’s the only time you could have it in May.","TOM:           Oh. Well, we could manage that, I think. We’d just <b>need to change</b> a couple of things. How much would it cost?","SHIRLEY:     That’s the beginning of high season, so it’d be £550 for the week. (Q2)","TOM:           Ah. That’s a bit more than we wanted to pay, I’m afraid. We’ve budgeted up to £500 for accommodation.","SHIRLEY:     Well, we’ve <b>just finished</b> converting another building into a cottage, which we’re calling Chervil Cottage. (Q3)","TOM:           Sorry? What was that again?","SHIRLEY:     Chervil. C-H-E-R-V for Victor I-L.","TOM:           Oh, that’s a herb, isn’t it?","SHIRLEY:     That’s right.

So could you <b>tell <b><b>me some</b>thing</b></b> about it, please?","SHIRLEY:     Of course. The building was built as a garage (Q4). It’s a little smaller than <b>Granary Cottage</b>.","TOM:           So that must sleep <b>two people</b>, as well?","SHIRLEY:     That’s right. There’s a double bedroom.","TOM:           <b>Does it have</b> a garden? (Q5)","SHIRLEY:     Yes, you get to it from the <b>living room</b> through French doors, and we <b>provide two</b> deckchairs.

It sometimes gets quite cool at that <b>time of year</b>.","SHIRLEY:     There’s central heating, and if you want to light a fire, there’s a stove. We can provide all the wood you need for it (Q7).

Well, we <b>now have</b> the results of the survey carried out last month about traffic and <b>road transport</b> in the town. <b>People were generally</b> satisfied with the state of the roads. There were <b>one or two</b> complaints about<b> potholes </b>which will be addressed, but a <b>significant number</b> of people complained about the <b>increasing number</b> of heavy<b> vehicles </b>(Q11) using our local roads to avoid traffic elsewhere.","We’d expected more complaints by<b> commuters </b>about the<b> reduction </b>in the train service, but it doesn’t seem to <b>have affected</b> <b>people too</b> much. The <b>cycle path</b> that runs <b>alongside the river</b> is <b><b>very well</b> used</b> by both cyclists and<b> pedestrians </b>since the surface was improved <b>last year</b>, but<b> overtaking </b>can be a problem so we’re going to <b>add a bit</b> on the side to make it wider (Q12). At some stage, we’d like to extend the path so that it goes <b>all the way</b> through the town, but that won’t be happening in the immediate future.","The plans to <b>have a <b>pedestrian crossing</b></b> next to the <b>Post Office</b> have unfortunately had to be put on hold for the time being. We’d budgeted for this to be done this financial year, but then there were<b> rumours </b>that the <b>Post Office</b> was going to move, which would <b>have meant</b> there wasn’t really a need for a crossing. Now they’ve confirmed that they’re staying where they are, but the Highways Department have told us that it would be dangerous to <b>have a <b>pedestrian crossing</b></b> where we’d originally planned it as there’s a bend in the road there (Q13). So that’ll <b>need some</b> more thought.","On Station Road near the station and level crossing, drivers can face <b>quite long</b> waits if the level crossing’s closed, and we’ve <b>now got</b> signs up requesting them not to leave their engines running at that time (Q14). This means<b> pedestrians </b>waiting on the<b> pavement </b>to cross the <b>railway line</b> don’t have to breathe in car fumes. We’ve had <b>some problems</b> with cyclists leaving their bikes chained to the<b> railings </b>outside the ticket office, but the station has agreed to provide bike racks there.","———————","CHAIRPERSON:","So <b>next on the agenda</b> is ‘Proposals for improvements to the<b> recreation </b>ground’. <b>Councillor Thornton</b> again.","<b>COUNCILLOR THORNTON</b>:","Well, since we managed to extend the<b> recreation </b>ground, we’ve spent <b>some time</b> talking to <b>local people</b> about how it could be made a more attractive and useful space. If you have a <b>look at the map</b> up on the screen, you can see the river up in the north, and the <b>Community Hall</b> near the <b>entrance from the road</b>.","At present, cars can park between the <b>Community Hall</b> and that <b>line of trees</b> to the east, but this is quite dangerous for<b> pedestrians </b>so we’re suggesting a new <b>car park</b> on the <b>opposite side</b> of the <b>Community Hall</b>, <b>right next</b> to it (Q15). We <b>also have</b> a <b>new location</b> for the<b> cricket </b>pitch.","As we’ve now purchased additional space to the east of the<b> recreation </b>ground, beyond the trees (Q16), we <b>plan to move</b> it away from its current location, which is rather near the road, into this <b>new area</b> beyond the <b>line of trees</b>. This means there’s less danger of<b> stray </b>balls hitting cars or pedestrians.","We’ve got plans for a children’s playground which will be accessible by a footpath from the <b>Community Hall</b> and will be <b>alongside the river</b> (Q17). We’d originally thought of having it close to the road, but we think this will be a more attractive location.","The <b>skateboard ramp</b> is <b>very popular</b> with both younger and <b>older children</b> – we had considered moving this up towards the river, but in the <b>end we decided</b> to have it in the southeast corner near the road (Q18). The<b> pavilion </b>is <b><b>very well</b> used</b> at present by both football players and cricketers. It will stay where it is now – to the left of the <b>line of trees</b> and near to the river (Q19) – handy for both the football and<b> cricket </b>pitches. And finally, we’ll be getting a new notice board for local information, and that will be directly on people’s right as they go from the road into the<b> recreation </b>ground. (Q20)","#3 Part 3 Transcript","The Part 3 <b>audio <b>transcript in Cambridge</b></b> 16 <b>Listening Test</b> 4 is as follows:","JAKE:     Now that we’ve done all the research into bike-sharing schemes in cities a<b>round the world</b>, we <b>need to think</b> about how we’re going to organise our report.","AMY:     Right. I think we should start by talking about the benefits. I mean it’s great that so many cities <b>have introduced</b> these schemes where anyone can <b>pick up</b> a bike from dozens of <b>different locations</b> and hire it for a <b>few hours</b>. It makes riding a bike very convenient for people.","JAKE:     Yes, but the costs can add up and that puts people on low incomes off in <b>some places</b>.","AMY:     I suppose so, but if it means more people in general are <b>cycling rather</b> than driving, then because they’re increasing the amount of <b>physical activity</b> they do, it’s good for their health","JAKE:     OK. But isn’t that of less importance? I mean, doesn’t the impact of reduced<b> emissions </b>on <b>air pollution</b> have a more <b>significant effect</b> on people’s health? (Q21/Q22)","AMY:     Certainly, in some cities bike-sharing <b>had made</b> a big contribution to that. And <b>also help</b>ed to cut the number of <b>cars on the road</b> significantly. (Q21/Q22)","JAKE:     Which is the <b>main point</b>.","AMY:     Exactly. But I’d say it’s had less of an impact on noise <b>pollution because</b> there are still loads of buses and<b> lorries </b>around.","JAKE:     Right.","AMY:     Shall we quickly discuss the recommendations we’re going to make?","JAKE:     In order to ensure bike-sharing schemes are successful?","AMY:     Yes.","JAKE:     OK. Well, while I think it’s nice to <b>have really</b> state-of-the art bikes with <b>things like</b> GPS, I wouldn’t say they’re absolutely necessary.","AMY:     But some technical things are <b>really important</b> – like a <b>fully functional</b> app – so people can make payments and book bikes easily (Q23/Q24). Places which haven’t invested in that <b>have really</b> struggled.","JAKE:     <b>Good point</b> … <b>Some people</b> say there shouldn’t be competing companies offering separate bike-sharing schemes, but in <b>some really</b> big cities, competition’s beneficial and anyway one company might not be <b>able to manage</b> the <b>whole thing</b>.","AMY:     Right. Deciding how much to invest is a big question. Cities which have opened loads of new bike<b> lanes </b>at the <b>same time</b> as introducing bike-sharing schemes <b>have generally</b> been more successful – but there are examples of successful schemes where this hasn’t happened … What <b>does matter</b> though – is <b>having a big</b> publicity campaign. (Q23/Q24)","JAKE:     Definitely. If <b>people do</b>n’t know how to use the scheme or don’t understand its benefits, they won’t use it. People <b>need a lot</b> of<b> persuasion </b>to stop using their cars.","—————————-","AMY:     Shall we <b>look at <b>some examples</b></b> now? And say what we think is good or bad about them.","JAKE:     I suppose we should start with Amsterdam as this was <b>one of the first</b> cities to have a bike-sharing scheme.","AMY:     Yes. There was already a strong culture of cycling here. In a way it’s strange that there was such a demand for bike-sharing because you’d <b>have thought</b> most <b>people would have</b> used their own bikes. (Q25)","JAKE:     And yet it’s <b>one of the best</b>-used schemes … Dublin’s an interesting example of a success story.","AMY:     It must be because the <b>public transport</b> system’s quite limited. (Q26)","JAKE:     Not really – there’s no underground, but there are<b> trams </b>and a good bus network. I’d say price <b>has a lot</b> to do with it. It’s one of the cheapest schemes in Europe to join.","AMY:     But the buses are <b>really slow</b> – anyway the weather certainly can’t be a factor!","JAKE:     No – definitely not. The London scheme’s been quite successful","AMY:     Yes – it’s been a <b>really good</b> thing for the city. The bikes are popular and the whole system is well maintained but it isn’t expanding quickly enough.","JAKE:     Basically, not enough’s been spent on increasing the number of <b>cycle lanes</b> (Q27). Hopefully that’ll change.","AMY:     Yes. Now what about outside Europe?","JAKE:     Well bike-sharing <b>schemes have</b> taken off in places like Buenos Aires.","AMY:     Mmm. They built a huge network of <b>cycle lanes</b> to support the introduction of the scheme there, didn’t they? It attracted <b><b>huge number</b>s</b> of cyclists where previously there were <b>hardly any</b>.","JAKE:     An example of good planning. (Q28)","AMY:     Absolutely. <b>New York</b> is a <b>good example</b> of how not to introduce a scheme. When they launched it, it was more than <b>ten times</b> the price of <b>most other</b> schemes.","JAKE:     More than it costs to take a taxi, Crazy (Q29). I think the organisers lacked vision and ambition there.","AMY:     I think so too. Sydney would be a <b>good example</b> to use. I would <b>have expected</b> it to <b>have grown</b> pretty quickly here. (Q30)","JAKE:     Yes. I can’t quite work out why it hasn’t been an instant success like <b>some of the other</b>s. It’s a shame really.","AMY:     I know. OK so now we’ve thought about …","#4 The <b><b>extinction of Dodo</b> bird</b> Transcript","The Part 4 <b>audio script</b> of The <b><b>extinction of Dodo</b> bird</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 4 is as follows:","<b><b>One of the most</b> famous</b> cases of extinction is that of a bird known as the dodo. In fact there’s even a saying in English, ‘as dead as the dodo’, used to refer to something which <b>no longer</b> exists. But for <b>many centuries</b> the<b> dodo </b>was alive and well, although it could only be found in one place, the island of Mauritius in the <b>Indian Ocean</b>.","It was a <b>very large</b> bird, about one metre tall, and over the centuries it <b>had <b>lost the ability</b></b> to fly, but it survived happily under the trees that covered the island.","Then in the year 1507 the first Portuguese ships stopped at the island. The sailors were carrying<b> spices </b>(Q31) back to Europe, and found the island a convenient stopping place where they could stock up with <b>food and water</b> for the rest of the voyage, but they didn’t settle on Mauritius.","However, in 1683 the <b>Dutch arrived</b> and <b>set up</b> a colony (Q32) there. These first human<b> inhabitants </b>of the island found the <b>dodo bird</b>s a convenient source of meat, although not everyone liked the taste.","It’s hard to get an accurate description of what the<b> dodo </b>actually <b>looked like</b>. We do <b>have some</b> written records from sailors, and a few pictures, but we don’t know how reliable these are. The best-known picture is a Dutch painting in which the bird appears to be extremely fat (Q33), but this may not be accurate – an Indian painting done at the <b>same time</b> shows a much thinner bird.","Although <b>attempts were made</b> to<b> preserve </b>the bodies of some of the birds, no complete<b> specimen </b>survives. In the early 17th century four<b> dried </b>parts of a bird were known to exist – of these, three have disappeared, so only <b>one example</b> of soft tissue from the<b> dodo </b>survives, a<b> dodo </b>head (Q34). Bones have <b>also found</b>, but there’s <b>only one</b> complete skeleton in existence.","This single<b> dodo </b>skeleton <b>has recently</b> been the subject of scientific research which suggests that many of the earlier beliefs about<b> dodos </b>may have been incorrect. For example, early accounts of the birds mention how slow and clumsy it was, but <b><b>scientists now</b> believe</b> the bird’s strong knee joints would <b>have made</b> it capable of movement (Q35) which was not slow, but <b>actually quite</b> fast.","In fact, one 17th century sailor wrote that he found the birds hard to catch. It’s true that the dodo’s small wings wouldn’t <b><b>have all</b>owed</b> it to leave the ground, but the scientists suggest that these were probably employed for balance (Q36) while going over uneven ground.","<b>Another group</b> of scientists carried out analysis of the dodo’s skull. They found that the reports of the lack of intelligence of the<b> dodo </b>were not borne out by their research, which suggested the bird’s brain (Q37) was not small, but average in size. In fact, in relation to its body size, it was similar to that of the pigeon, which is known to be a highly intelligent bird.","The researchers <b>also found</b> that the structure of the bird’s skull <b>suggested that one</b> sense which was particularly well-developed was that of smell (Q38). So the<b> dodo </b>may also <b>have been particularly</b> good at locating ripe fruit and <b>other food</b> in the island’s <b>thick vegetation</b>.","————————————–","So it looks as if the<b> dodo </b>was <b>better able</b> to survive and defend itself than was originally believed. Yet less than 200 years after Europeans first arrived on the island, they had <b>become extinct</b>. So what was the reason for this? For a <b>long time</b>, it was believed that the<b> dodos </b>were hunted to extinction, but <b><b>scientists now</b> believe</b> the situation was more complicated than this.","Another factor may have been the <b>new species</b> <b>brought to the island</b> by the sailors. These included dogs, which would have been a threat to the dodos, and also monkeys, which ate the fruit that was the <b>main part</b> of the dodos’ diet. These were <b>brought to the island</b> deliberately, but the ships also brought <b>another type</b> of creature – rats (Q39), which came to land from the ships and rapidly<b> overran </b>the island.","These upset the<b> ecology </b>of the island, not just the<b> dodos </b>but <b>other species</b> too. However, they were a particular danger to the<b> dodos </b>because they consumed their eggs, and since each<b> dodo </b>only<b> laid </b>one at a time, this <b>probably had</b> a<b> devastating </b>effect on populations.","However, we <b>now think</b> that probably the <b>main cause</b> of the birds’ extinction was not the introduction of non-native species, but the introduction of agriculture.","This meant that the forest (Q40) that has once covered all the island, and that had provided a perfect home for the dodo, was cut down so that <b>crops such</b> as sugar could be grown. So although the<b> dodo </b>had survived for <b>thousands of years</b>, suddenly it was gone."]},{"name":"ARE/10-1-1","paragraph":["<h2>Stepwells</h2>","<b>A </b><b> millennium </b>ago,<b> stepwells </b>were fundamental to life in the driest parts of India. <b>Although many</b> have been neglected, recent<b> restoration </b>has returned them to their former glory. Richard Cox travelled to north-western India to document these<b> spectacular </b>monuments from a bygone era.","During the sixth and seventh centuries, the<b> inhabitants </b>of the modern-day states of Gujarat and Rajasthan in North-western India developed a method of gaining access to clean, fresh<b> groundwater </b>during the dry season for drinking, bathing, watering animals and irrigation. However, the significance of this invention – the<b> stepwell </b>– goes beyond its<b> utilitarian </b>application.","Unique to the region,<b> stepwells </b>are often architecturally complex and vary widely in size and shape. During their heyday, they were places of gathering, of leisure, of<b> relaxation </b>and of worship for villagers of all but the lowest castes. Most<b> stepwells </b>are found<b> dotted </b>around the<b> desert </b>areas of Gujarat (where they are called vav) and Rajasthan (where they are known as baori), <b>while a few</b> also survive in Delhi. Some were located in or near villages as public spaces for the community; others were positioned beside roads as resting places for travellers.","As their name suggests,<b> stepwells </b>comprise a series of stone steps descending from <b>ground level</b> to the <b>water source</b> (normally an underground aquifer) as it recedes following the rains. When the water level was high, the user needed only to descend a few steps to reach it; when it was low, several levels would have to be negotiated.","Some wells are vast, open craters with hundreds of steps paving each sloping side, often in tiers. Others are more elaborate, with long stepped passages leading to the water via several<b> storeys </b>built from stone and supported by pillars, they also included pavilions that sheltered visitors from the<b> relentless </b>heat. But <b>perhaps the most</b><b> impressive </b>features are the<b> intricate </b>decorative<b> sculptures </b>that embellish many stepwells, showing activities from fighting and dancing to everyday acts such as women combing their hair and churning butter.","Down the centuries, thousands of wells were constructed throughout northwestern India, but the majority <b>have no</b>w fallen into disuse; many are<b> derelict </b>and dry, as<b> groundwater </b>has been diverted for<b> industrial </b>use and the wells <b>no longer</b> reach the water table. Their condition hasn’t been helped by recent dry spells: southern Rajasthan suffered an eight-year<b> drought </b>between 1996 and 2004.","However, some important sites in Gujarat have recently underg<b>one major</b> restoration, and the state government announced in June <b>last year</b> that it plans to restore the<b> stepwells </b>throughout the state.","In Patan, the state’s ancient capital, the<b> stepwell </b>of Rani Ki Vav (Queen’s Stepwell) is perhaps the finest current example. It was built by Queen Udayamati during the late 11th century, but became silted up following a flood during the 13th century. But the <b>Archaeological Survey</b> of India began restoring it in the 1960s, and today it’s in pristine condition. At 65 metres long, 20 <b>metres wide</b> and 27 metres deep, Rani Ki Vav features 500 distinct<b> sculptures </b>carved into<b> niches </b>throughout the monument, depicting gods such as Vishnu and Parvati in various incarnations. Incredibly, in January 2001, this ancient structure survived a<b> devastating </b>earthquake that measured 7.6 on the Richter scale.","Another example is the Surya Kund in Modhera, northern Gujarat, next to the Sun Temple, built by King Bhima I in 1026 to honour the <b>sun god</b> Surya. It’s actually a tank (kund means<b> reservoir </b>or pond) rather than a well, but displays the hallmarks of<b> stepwell </b>architecture, including four sides of steps that descend to the bottom in a stunning<b> geometrical </b>formation. The<b> terraces </b>house 108 small,<b> intricately </b>carved<b> shrines </b>between the sets of steps.","Rajasthan <b>also has</b> a wealth of wells. The ancient city of Bundi, 200 kilometres south of Jaipur, is<b> renowned </b>for its architecture, including its stepwells. One of the larger examples is Raniji Ki Baori, which was built by the queen of the region, Nathavatji, in 1699. At 46 metres deep, 20 <b>metres wide</b> and 40 metres long, the<b> intricately </b>carved monument is one of 21 baoris<b> commissioned </b>in the Bundi area by Nathavatji.","In the old ruined town of Abhaneri, about 95 kilometres east of Jaipur, is Chand Baori, one of India’s oldest and deepest wells; aesthetically, it’s perhaps <b>one of the most</b> dramatic. Built in around 850 AD next to the temple of Harshat Mata, the<b> baori </b>comprises hundreds of zigzagging steps that run along three of its sides, steeply descending 11 storeys, resulting in a striking geometric pattern when seen from afar. On the fourth side, covered verandas supported by ornate<b> pillars </b>overlook the steps.","Still in public use is Neemrana Ki Baori, located just off the Jaipur–Dehli highway. Constructed in around 1700, it’s nine<b> storeys </b>deep, with the <b>last two</b> levels underwater. At <b>ground level</b>, there are 86 colonnaded openings from where the visitor descends 170 steps to the deepest <b>water source</b>.","Today, following years of neglect, many of these monuments to<b> medieval </b>engineering have been saved by the <b>Archaeological Survey</b> of India, which has recognised the importance of<b> preserving </b>them as part of the country’s rich history. Tourists<b> flock </b>to wells in far-flung corners of northwestern India to gaze in wonder at these architectural marvels from 1,000 <b>years ago</b>, which serve as a reminder of both the<b> ingenuity </b>and artistry of <b>ancient civilisations</b> and of the value of water to human existence."]},{"name":"ARE/10-1-2","paragraph":["<h2>EUROPEAN TRANSPORT SYSTEMS 1990-2010</h2>","What have been the trends and what are the prospects for European <b><b>transport system</b>s</b>?","<b>A</b>","It is difficult to<b> conceive </b>of vigorous <b>economic growth</b> without an efficient <b>transport system</b>. Although modern information technologies can reduce the demand for physical transport by facilitating teleworking and teleservices, the requirement for transport continues to increase. There are two key factors behind this trend. For passenger transport, the determining factor is the<b> spectacular </b>growth in car use. The <b>number of cars</b> on European Union (EU) roads saw an increase of <b>three million</b> cars <b>each year</b> from 1990 to 2010, and in the next decade, the EU will see a further<b> substantial </b>increase in its fleet.","<b>B</b>","As far as goods transport is concerned, growth is due to a large extent to changes in the European economy and its system of production. In the last 20 years, as internal frontiers have been abolished, the EU has moved from a ”stock” economy to a ”flow” economy. This<b> phenomenon </b>has been<b> emphasised </b>by the relocation of some industries, particularly those which are<b> labour </b>intensive, to reduce production costs, <b>even though</b> the production site is hundreds or even thousands of kilometres away from the final assembly plant or away from users.","<b>C</b>","The strong <b>economic growth</b> expected in countries which are candidates for entry to the EU will also increase transport flows, in particular, road<b> haulage </b>traffic. In 1998, some of these countries already exported more than twice their 1990 volumes and imported more than <b>five times</b> their 1990 volumes. And <b>although many</b> candidate countries inherited a <b>transport system</b> which encourages rail, the distribution between modes has tipped sharply in favour of <b>road transport</b> since the 1990s. Between 1990 and 1998，road<b> haulage </b>increased by 19.4%, while during the same period rail<b> haulage </b>decreased by 43.5%, although – and this could benefit the enlarged EU – it is still on average at a <b>much <b>higher level</b></b> than in existing member states.","<b>D</b>","However, a new imperative-sustainable development – offers an opportunity for adapting the EU’s common transport policy. This objective, agreed by the Gothenburg European Council, has to be achieved by integrating environmental considerations into Community policies, and shifting the balance between <b>modes of transport</b> lies at the heart of its strategy. The ambitious objective can only be fully achieved by 2020, but proposed measures are nonetheless a first essential step towards a<b> sustainable </b><b>transport system</b> which will ideally be in place in 30 years‟ time, that is by 2040.","<b>E</b>","In 1998, energy consumption in the transport sector was to blame for 28% of<b> emissions </b>of CO2，the leading <b>greenhouse gas</b>. According to the latest estimates, if nothing is done to reverse the traffic growth trend, CO2<b> emissions </b>from transport can be expected to increase by around 50% to 1,113 billion tonnes by 2020，compared with the 739 billion tonnes recorded in 1990. <b>Once again</b>, <b>road transport</b> is the main<b> culprit </b>since it alone accounts for 84% of the CO2 emissions<b> attributable </b>to transport. Using alternative<b> fuels </b>and improving energy efficiency is thus both an<b> ecological </b>necessity and a technological challenge.","<b>F</b>","At the <b>same time</b>, greater efforts must be made to achieve a modal shift. Such a change cannot be achieved overnight, all the less so after over half a century of constant deterioration in favour of road. This has reached such a<b> pitch </b>that today rail<b> freight </b>services are facing marginalisation, with just 8% of <b>market share</b>, and with international goods trains struggling along at an average speed of 18km/h. Three possible options have emerged.","<b>G</b>","The first approach would consist of focusing on <b>road transport</b> solely through pricing. This option would not be accompanied by complementary measures in the other <b>modes of transport</b>. In the short term, it might curb the growth in <b>road transport</b> through the better loading ratio of <b>goods vehicles</b> and occupancy rates of passenger<b> vehicles </b>expected as a result of the increase in the price of transport. However, the lack of measures available to revitalise other <b>modes of transport</b> would make it impossible for more<b> sustainable </b><b>modes of transport</b> to <b>take up</b> the baton.","<b>H</b>","The second approach also concentrates on <b>road transport</b> pricing but is accompanied by measures to increase the efficiency of the <b>other modes</b> (better quality of services, logistics, technology). However, this approach does not include investment in new infrastructure, nor does it<b> guarantee </b>better regional cohesion. It could help to achieve greater uncoupling than the first approach, but <b>road transport</b> would keep the lion‟s share of the market and continue to<b> concentrate </b>on saturated arteries, despite being the most<b> polluting </b>of the modes. It is therefore not enough to<b> guarantee </b>the necessary shift of the balance.","<b>I</b>","The third approach, which is not new, comprises a series of measures ranging from pricing to revitalising alternative <b>modes of transport</b> and targeting investment in the trans-European network. This integrated approach would allow the <b>market share</b>s of the <b>other modes</b> to return to their 1998 levels and thus make a shift of balance. It is far more ambitious than it looks, bearing in mind the historical imbalance in favour of roads for the last <b>fifty years</b>, but would achieve a marked break in the link between <b>road transport</b> growth and <b>economic growth</b>, without placing restrictions on the mobility of people and goods."]},{"name":"ARE/10-1-3","paragraph":["<h2>The Psychology of Innovation</h2>","Why are so few companies truly innovative?","Innovation is key to business survival, and companies put<b> substantial </b>resources into inspiring employees to <b>develop new</b> ideas. There are, nevertheless, <b>people working</b> in luxurious, state-of-the-art centres designed to<b> stimulate </b>innovation who find that their environment doesn’t make them feel at all creative. And there are those who don’t have a budget, or much space, but who innovate successfully.","For Robert B. Cialdini, <b>Professor of Psychology</b> at Arizona <b>State University</b>, <b>one reason</b> that companies don’t succeed as often as they should is that innovation starts with recruitment. <b>Research shows</b> that the fit between an employee’s values and a company’s values makes a difference to what contribution they make and whether, <b>two years</b> after they join, they’re still at the company. Studies at Harvard <b>Business School</b> show that, <b>although some</b> individuals may be more creative than others, <b>almost every</b> individual can be creative in the right circumstances.","<b><b>One of the most</b> famous</b><b> photographs </b>in the story of rock’n’roll emphasises Ciaidini’s views. The 1956 picture of singers Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash and Jerry Lee Lewis jamming at a piano in Sun Studios in Memphis tells a hidden story. Sun’s ‘million-dollar quartet’ could have been a quintet. Missing from the picture is Roy Orbison’ a greater natural singer than Lewis, Perkins or Cash. Sam Phillips, who owned Sun, wanted to<b> revolutionise </b><b>popular music</b> with songs that fused black and white music, and country and blues. Presley, Cash, Perkins and Lewis instinctively understood Phillips’s ambition and believed in it. Orbison wasn’t inspired by the goal, and only ever achieved one hit with the Sun label.","The value fit matters, says Cialdini, because innovation is, in part, a process of change, and under that pressure we, as a species, be<b>have different</b>ly, ‘ When things change, we are hard-wired to play it safe .’ Managers should, therefore, adopt an approach that appears counterintuitive -they should explain what stands to be lost if the company fails to seize a particular opportunity. <b>Studies show</b> that we<b> invariably </b>take more gambles when<b> threatened </b>with a loss than when offered a reward.","Managing innovation is a delicate art. It’s easy for a company to be pulled in conflicting directions as the marketing, product development, and finance departments each get different feedback from different sets of people. And without a system which ensures<b> collaborative </b>exchanges within the company, it’s also easy for small ‘pockets of innovation‟ to disappear. Innovation is a contact sport. You can‟t brief <b>people just</b> by saying, ‘We’re going in this direction and I’m <b>going to take</b> you with me.’","Cialdini believes that this ‘follow-the-leader syndrome, is dangerous, not least because it encourages bosses to go it alone. ‘It’s been<b> scientifically </b>proven that three people will be better than one at solving problems, even if that <b>one person</b> is the smartest person in the field.’ To prove his point, Cialdini cites an interview with<b> molecular </b>biologist James Watson. Watson, together with Francis Crick, discovered the structure of DNA, the genetic information carrier of all living organisms. ‘When asked how they had<b> cracked </b>the code ahead of an array of highly accomplished<b> rival </b>investigators, he said something that<b> stunned </b>me. He said ” he and Crick had succeeded because they were aware that they weren’t the most intelligent of the scientists pursuing the answer. The smartest scientist was called Rosalind Franklin who, Watson said, “was so intelligent she rarely<b> sought </b>advice”.’","Teamwork taps into one of the basic drivers of human behaviour. ‘The<b> principle </b>of<b> social </b>proof is so pervasive that we don’t even recognise it,’ says Cialdini. ‘If your project is being resisted, for example, by a group of veteran employees, ask another old-timer to speak up for it.’ Cialdini is not alone in advocating this strategy. <b>Research shows</b> that peer power, used horizontally not vertically, is much more powerful than any boss’s speech.","Writing, visualising and prototyping can<b> stimulate </b>the flow of <b>new ideas</b>. Cialdini cites scores of research papers and historical events that prove that even <b>something as simple</b> as writing deepens every individual’s engagement in the project. It is, he says, the reason why all those competitions on breakfast cereal packets encouraged us to write in saying, in no more than 10 words: ‘I like Kellogg’s Com Flakes because… .’ The very act of writing makes us more likely to believe it.","Authority doesn’t have to<b> inhibit </b>innovation but it often does. The wrong kind of leadership will lead to what Cialdini calls ”captainitis, the regrettable<b> tendency </b>of <b>team members</b> to opt out of team<b> responsibilities </b>that are properly their ’. He calls it captainitis because, he says, ”crew members of multipilot aircraft exhibit a sometimes deadly passivity when the flight captain makes a clearly wrong-headed decision”. This behaviour is not, he says, unique to air travel, but can happen in any workplace where the leader is overbearing.","At the <b>other end</b> of the scale is the 1980s Memphis design collective, a group of <b>young designers</b> for whom ”the only rule was that there were no rule”. This environment encouraged a free interchange of ideas, which led to more creativity with form, function, colour and materials that revolutionised attitudes to furniture design.","Many<b> theorists </b>believe the ideal boss should lead from behind, taking pride in collective accomplishment and giving credit where it is due. Cialdini says: ”Leaders should encourage everyone to contribute and<b> simultaneously </b>assure all concerned that every<b> recommendation </b>is important to making the <b>right decision</b> and will be <b>given full</b> attention ”. The frustrating thing about innovation is that there are many approaches, but no magic formula. However, a manager who wants to create a truly innovative culture can make their job a lot easier by recognising these<b> psychological </b>realities."]},{"name":"ARE/10-2-1","paragraph":["<h2>Tea and the Industrial Revolution</h2>","<b>A </b> Cambridge professor says “a change in drinking habits was the reason for the <b>Industrial Revolution</b> in Britain.” – Anjana Abuja reports","<b>A.</b>  Alan Macfarlane, professor of anthropological science at King’s College, Cambridge has, <b>like other</b> historians, spent decades wrestling with the enigma of the <b>Industrial Revolution</b>. Why did this particular Big Bang – the world-changing birth of industry – happen in Britain? And why did it strike at the end of the 18th century?","<b>B.</b>  Macfarlane compares the puzzle to a combination lock. ‘There are about 20 different factors and all of them need to be present before the revolution can happen,’ he says. For industry to take off, there needs to be the technology and power to drive factories, large urban populations to provide cheap labour, easy transport to move goods around, an affluent middle-class willing to buy mass-produced objects, a market-driven economy and a political system that allows this to happen. While this was the case for England, other nations, such as Japan, the Netherlands and France also met some of these criteria but were not industrialising. All these factors must have been necessary. But not sufficient to cause the revolution, says Macfarlane. ‘After all, Holland had everything except coal while China <b>also had</b> many of these factors. Most historians are convinced there are <b>one or two</b> missing factors that you <b>need to open</b> the lock.’","<b>C.</b>  The missing factors, he proposes, are to be found in almost even kitchen cupboard. Tea and beer, two of the nation’s favourite drinks,<b> fuelled </b>the revolution. The antiseptic properties of tannin, the active ingredient in tea, and of<b> hops </b>in beer – plus the fact that both are made with boiled water – allowed urban communities to flourish at close<b> quarters </b>without succumbing to water-borne diseases such as dysentery. The theory sounds<b> eccentric </b>but once he starts to explain the detective work that went into his deduction, the<b> scepticism </b>gives way to wary admiration. Macfarlanes case has been<b> strengthened </b>by support from notable<b> quarters </b>– Roy Porter, the distinguished medical historian, recently wrote a favourable appraisal of his research.","<b>D.</b>  Macfarlane had wondered for a <b>long time</b> how the <b>Industrial Revolution</b> came about. Historians had alighted on one interesting factor around the mid-18th century that required explanation. Between about 1650 and 1740，the population in Britain was static. But then there was a burst in <b>population growth</b>. Macfarlane says: ‘The infant<b> mortality </b>rate halved in the space of 20 years, and this happened in both <b>rural areas</b> and cities, and <b>across all</b> classes. People suggested four possible causes. Was there a sudden change in the viruses and<b> bacteria </b>around? Unlikely. Was there a revolution in medical science? But this was a century before Lister’s revolution*. Was there a change in environmental conditions? There were improvements in agriculture that wiped out malaria, but these were small gains. Sanitation did not become widespread until the 19th century. The only option left is food. But the height and weight<b> statistics </b>show a decline. So the food must <b>have got</b> worse. Efforts to explain this sudden<b> reduction </b>in child<b> deaths </b>appeared to draw a blank .’","<b>E.</b>  This population burst seemed to happen at just the right time to provide<b> labour </b>for the <b>Industrial Revolution</b>. ‘When you start moving towards an <b>industrial revolution</b>, it is economically efficient to have <b>people living</b> close together,’  says Macfarlane. ‘But then you get disease, particularly from human waste.’ Some<b> digging </b>around in historical records revealed that there was a change in the incidence of water-borne disease at that time, especially dysentery. Macfarlane deduced that whatever the British were drinking must have been important in regulating disease. He says, ‘We<b> drank </b>beer. For a <b>long time</b>, the English were protected by the strong<b> antibacterial </b>agent in hops, which were added to help<b> preserve </b>the beer. But in the late 17th century a tax was introduced on malt, the basic ingredient of beer. The poor turned to water and gin and in the 1720s the<b> mortality </b>rate began to rise again. Then it suddenly dropped again. What caused this?’","<b>F.</b>  Macfarlane looked to Japan, which was also developing large cities about the <b>same time</b>, and <b>also had</b> no sanitation. Water-borne diseases had a much looser grip on the Japanese population than those in Britain. Could it be the prevalence of tea in their culture? Macfarlane then noted that the history of tea in Britain provided an extraordinary<b> coincidence </b>of dates. Tea was relatively expensive until Britain started a direct<b> clipper </b>trade with China in the early 18th century. By the 1740s, about the time that infant<b> mortality </b>was dipping, the drink was common. Macfarlane guessed that the fact that water had to be boiled, together with the stomach-purifying properties of tea meant that the breast milk provided by mothers was healthier than it had ever been. <b>No other</b> European nation sipped tea like the British, which, by Macfarlanes logic, pushed these <b>other countries</b> out of contention for the revolution.","<b>G.</b>  But, if tea is a factor in the combination lock, why didn’t Japan forge ahead in a tea-soaked <b>industrial revolution</b> of its own? Macfarlane notes that <b>even though</b> 17th-century Japan <b>had large</b> cities, high literacy rates, even a futures market, it had turned its back on the essence of any work-based revolution by giving up labour-saving devices such as animals, afraid that they would put people out of work. So, the nation that we <b>now think</b> of as <b>one of the most</b> technologically advanced entered the 19th century having ‘abandoned the wheel’."]},{"name":"ARE/10-2-2","paragraph":["<h2>Gifted children and learning</h2>","<b>A.</b>  Internationally, ‘giftedness’ is most frequently determined by a score on a general intelligence test, known as an IQ test, which is above a chosen<b> cutoff </b>point, usually at around the top 2-5%. Children’s educational environment contributes to the IQ score and the way intelligence is used. For example, a <b>very close</b> positive relationship was found when children’s IQ scores were compared with their home educational<b> provision </b>(Freeman, 2010). The higher the children’s IQ scores, especially over IQ 130, the better the quality of their educational backup, measured in terms of reported verbal interactions with parents, number of books and activities in their home etc. Because IQ tests are decidedly influenced by what the child has learned, they are to <b>some extent</b> measures of current achievement based on age-norms; that is, how well the <b>children have</b> learned to manipulate their knowledge and know-how within the terms of the test. The vocabulary aspect, for example, is dependent on having heard those words. But IQ tests can neither identify the processes of learning and thinking nor predict creativity.","<b>B.</b> <b> Excellence </b>does not<b> emerge </b>without appropriate help. To reach an exceptionally high standard in any area very able children need the means to learn, which includes material to work with and focused challenging tuition -and the encouragement to follow their dream. There appears to be a qualitative difference in the way the intellectually highly able think, compared with more average-ability or older pupils, for whom<b> external </b>regulation by the teacher often compensates for lack of internal regulation. To be at their <b>most effective</b> in their self-regulation, all children can be helped to identify their own ways of learning –<b> metacognition </b>– which will include strategies of planning, monitoring, evaluation, and choice of what to learn. Emotional awareness is also part of metacognition, so children should be helped to be aware of their feelings around the area to be learned, feelings of<b> curiosity </b>or confidence, for example.","<b>C.</b>  High achievers <b>have been found</b> to use self-regulatory learning strategies more often and more effectively than lower achievers, and are <b>better able</b> to transfer these strategies to deal with unfamiliar tasks. This happens to such a high degree in some children that they appear to be demonstrating talent in <b>particular area</b>s. Overviewing research on the thinking process of highly able children, (Shore and Kanevsky, 1993) put the instructor’s problem succinctly: ‘ If they [the gifted] merely think more quickly, then we need only teach more quickly. If they merely make fewer errors, then we can shorten the practice ’. But of course, this is not entirely the case; adjustments have to be made in methods of learning and teaching, to take account of the <b>many ways</b> individuals think.","<b>D.</b>  Yet in order to learn by themselves, the gifted do <b>need some</b> support from their teachers. Conversely, teachers who have a<b> tendency </b>to ‘overdirect’ can<b> diminish </b>their gifted pupils’ learning autonomy. Although ‘ spoon-feeding ’ can produce extremely high examination results, these are not always followed by equally<b> impressive </b>life successes. <b>Too much</b> dependence on the teachers risks loss of autonomy and motivation to discover. However, when teachers o pupils to reflect on their own learning and thinking activities, they increase their pupils’ self-regulation. For a young child, it may be just the simple question ‘What have you learned today?’ which helps them to recognise what they are doing. Given that a fundamental goal of education is to transfer the control of learning from teachers to pupils, improving pupils’ learning to <b>learn techniques</b> should be a major outcome of the school experience, especially for the highly competent. There are <b>quite a number</b> of new methods which can help, such as child– initiated learning, ability-peer tutoring, etc. Such practices <b>have been found</b> to be <b>particularly useful</b> for bright children from deprived areas.","<b>E.</b>  But scientific progress is not all theoretical, knowledge is a so vital to<b> outstanding </b>performance: individuals who know a <b>great deal</b> about a specific domain will achieve at a <b>higher level</b> than those who do not (Elshout, 1995). Research with creative scientists by Simonton (1988) brought him to the conclusion that above a certain <b>high level</b>, characteristics such as independence seemed to contribute more to reaching the highest levels of expertise than intellectual skills, due to the great demands of effort and time needed for learning and practice. Creativity in all forms can be seen as expertise as mixed with a <b>high level</b> of motivation (Weisberg, 1993).","<b>F.</b>  To sum up, learning is affected by emotions of both the individual and significant others. Positive emotions<b> facilitate </b>the creative aspects of earning and <b>negative emotions</b><b> inhibit </b>it. Fear, for example, can limit the development of curiosity, which is a strong force in scientific advance, because it motivates problem-solving behaviour. In Boekaerts ’ (1991) review of emotion the learning of <b>very high</b> IQ and highly achieving children, she found emotional forces in harness. They were not only curious, but often had a strong desire to control their environment, improve their learning efficiency and increase their own learning resources."]},{"name":"ARE/10-2-3","paragraph":["<h2>Museums of Fine Art and their Public</h2>","The <b>fact that people</b> go to the Louvre museum in Paris to see the original painting <b>Mona Lisa</b> when they can see a reproduction anywhere leads us to question some assumptions about the role of museums of <b>fine art</b> in today’s world.","<b><b>One of the most</b> famous</b> <b>works of art</b> in the world is <b>Leonardo da</b> Vinci’s <b>Mona Lisa</b>. <b>Nearly everyone</b> who goes to see the original will already be familiar with it from reproductions, but they accept that <b>fine art</b> is more rewardingly viewed in its original form.","However, if <b>Mona Lisa</b> was a famous novel, <b>few people</b> would bother to go to a museum to read the writer’s actual<b> manuscript </b>rather than a printed reproduction. This might be explained by the fact that the novel has evolved <b>precisely because</b> of technological developments that <b>made it possible</b> to print out <b><b>huge number</b>s</b> of texts, whereas oil paintings <b>have always</b> been produced as unique objects. In addition, it could be argued that the practice of<b> interpreting </b>or ‘reading’ each medium follows different conventions. With novels, the reader attends mainly to the meaning of words rather than the way they are printed on the page, whereas the ‘reader’ of a painting must attend just as closely to the material form of marks and shapes in the picture as to <b>any idea</b>s they may signify.","Yet it <b>has always</b> been possible to make very accurate facsimiles of <b>pretty well</b> any <b>fine art</b> work. The seven surviving versions of <b>Mona Lisa</b> bear witness to the fact that in the 16th century, artists seemed perfectly content to assign the reproduction of their creations to their workshop apprentices as regular ‘bread and butter’ work. And today the task of reproducing pictures is incomparably more simple and reliable, with reprographic techniques that allow the production of high-quality prints made exactly to the original scale, with faithful colour values, and even with duplication of the surface relief of the painting.","But despite an implicit recognition that the spread of good reproductions can be culturally valuable, museums continue to promote the special status of original work. Unfortunately, this seems to place severe limitations on the kind of experience offered to visitors.","One limitation is related to the way the museum presents its exhibits. As repositories of unique historical objects, art museums are often called ‘treasure houses’. We are reminded of this even before we view a collection by the presence of security guards, attendants, ropes and display cases to keep us away from the exhibits. In many cases, the architectural style of the building further reinforces that notion. In addition, a major collection like that of London’s National Gallery is housed in<b> numerous </b>rooms, each with dozens of works, <b>any one</b> of which is likely to be worth more than all the average visitor possesses. In a society that judges the personal status of the individual so much by their material worth, it is, therefore, difficult not to be impressed by one’s own relative ‘worthlessness’ in such an environment.","Furthermore, consideration of the ‘value’ of the original work in its treasure house setting impresses upon the viewer that, since these works were originally produced, they have been assigned a huge monetary value by some person or institution more powerful than themselves. Evidently, nothing the viewer thinks about the work is going to alter that value, and so today’s viewer is deterred from trying to extend that spontaneous, immediate, self-reliant kind of reading which would originally <b>have met</b> the work.","The visitor may then be struck by the strangeness of seeing such diverse paintings, drawings and<b> sculptures </b>brought together in an environment for which they were not originally created. This ‘displacement effect’ is further<b> heightened </b>by the<b> sheer </b>volume of exhibits. In the case of a major collection, there are probably more works on display than we could realistically view in weeks or even months.","This is particularly distressing because time seems to be a vital factor in the appreciation of all <b>art form</b>s. A fundamental difference between paintings and other <b>art form</b>s is that there is no<b> prescribed </b>time over which a painting is viewed. By contrast, the audience encourages an opera or a play over a specific time, which is the duration of the performance. Similarly, novels and poems are read in a<b> prescribed </b>temporal sequence, whereas a picture has <b>no clear</b> place at which to start viewing, or at which to finish. Thus artworks themselves encourage us to view them superficially, without appreciating the richness of detail and<b> labour </b>that is involved.","Consequently, the<b> dominant </b>critical approach becomes that of the art historian, a specialised academic approach<b> devoted </b>to ‘discovering the meaning’ of art within the cultural context of its time. This is in perfect harmony with the museum’s function, since the approach is dedicated to seeking out and conserving ‘authentic’, original, readings of the exhibits. Again, this seems to put paid to that spontaneous, participators criticism which can be found in abundance in criticism of classic works of literature, but is absent from most art history.","The displays of art museums serve as a warning of what critical practices can<b> emerge </b>when<b> spontaneous </b>criticism is suppressed. The museum public, like <b>any other</b> audience, experience art more rewardingly when given the confidence to express their views. If appropriate works of <b>fine art</b> could be rendered permanently accessible to the public by means of high-fidelity reproductions, as literature and music already are, the public may feel somewhat less in awe of them. Unfortunately, that may be <b>too much</b> to ask from those who seek to maintain and control the art establishment."]},{"name":"ARE/10-3-1","paragraph":["<h2>The Context, Meaning and Scope of Tourism</h2>","<b>A </b> Travel has existed <b>since the beginning</b> of time, when<b> primitive </b>man set out, often traversing great distances in search of game, which provided the food and clothing necessary for his survival. Throughout the course of history, <b>people have</b> travelled for purposes of trade,<b> religious </b>conviction, economic gain, war, migration and other equally compelling motivations. In the Roman era, wealthy aristocrats and high <b>government officials</b> also travelled for pleasure. Seaside resorts located at Pompeii and Herculaneum afforded citizens the opportunity to escape to their<b> vacation </b>villas in order to avoid the summer heat of Rome. Travel, except during the Dark Ages, has continued to grow and, throughout recorded history, has played a <b>vital role</b> in the development of civilisations and their economies.","<b>B </b>  Tourism in the mass form as we know it today is a distinctly twentieth-century phenomenon. Historians suggest that the<b> advent </b>of mass tourism began in England <b><b>during the industrial</b> revolution</b> with the rise of the middle class and the availability of relatively<b> inexpensive </b>transportation. The creation of the commercial airline industry following the <b>Second World</b> War and the subsequent development of the<b> jet </b>aircraft in the 1950s signalled the <b>rapid growth</b> and expansion of international travel. This growth <b>led to the development</b> of a major new industry: tourism. In turn, international tourism became the concern of a number of world governments since it not only provided new employment<b> opportunities </b>but also produced a means of earning foreign exchange.","<b>C </b>  Tourism today <b>has grown</b> significantly in both <b>economic and social</b> importance. In most<b> industrialised </b>countries over the past <b>few years</b> the fastest growth has been seen in the area of services. <b>One of the largest</b> segments of the service industry, although largely unrecognised as an entity in some of these countries, is <b>travel and tourism</b>. According to the World <b>Travel and Tourism</b> Council (1992), <b>Travel and tourism</b> is the largest industry in the world on virtually any economic measure including value-added capital investment, employment and tax contributions. In 1992’ the industry’s gross output was<b> estimated </b>to be $3.5 trillion, over 12 <b>per cent</b> of all consumer spending. The <b><b>travel and tourism</b> industry</b> is the world’s largest employer the almost 130 million jobs, or almost 7 <b>per cent</b> of <b>all employees</b>. This industry is the world’s leading<b> industrial </b>contributor, producing over 6 <b>per cent</b> of the world’s national product and accounting for capital investment in excess of $422 billion m direct indirect and personal taxes <b>each year</b>. Thus, tourism has a profound impact both on the world economy and, because of the educative effect of travel and the effects on employment, on society itself.","<b>D </b>  However, the <b>major problems</b> of the <b><b>travel and tourism</b> industry</b> that have hidden, or obscured, its <b>economic impact</b> are the diversity and fragmentation of the industry itself. The travel industry includes: hotels, motels and <b>other types</b> of accommodation; restaurants and <b>other food</b> services; transportation services and facilities; amusements, attractions and other leisure facilities; gift shops and a large <b>number of other</b> enterprises. Since many of these businesses also serve <b>local residents</b>, the impact of spending by visitors can easily be<b> overlooked </b>or underestimated. In addition, Meis (1992) points out that the <b>tourism industry</b> involves concepts that have remained amorphous to both analysts and decision makers. Moreover, in all nations this problem <b>has made</b> it difficult for the industry to develop any type of reliable or credible tourism information base in order to<b> estimate </b>the contribution it makes to regional, national and global economies. However, the nature of this very diversity makes <b>travel and tourism</b> ideal<b> vehicles </b>for economic development in a <b>wide variety</b> of countries, regions or communities.","<b>E </b> Once the<b> exclusive </b>province of the wealthy, <b>travel and tourism</b> <b>have become</b> an institutionalised way of life for most of the population. In fact, McIntosh and Goeldner (1990) suggest that tourism <b>has become</b> the largest commodity in international trade for many nations and, for a <b>significant number</b> of <b>other countries</b>, it ranks second or third. For example, tourism is the major <b>source of income</b> in Bermuda, Greece, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and most Caribbean countries. In addition, Hawkins and Ritchie, quoting from data published by the American Express Company, suggest that the <b><b>travel and tourism</b> industry</b> is the <b>number one</b> ranked employer in the Bahamas, Brazil, Canada, France, (the former) West Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the <b>United States</b>. However, because of problems of definition, which directly affect<b> statistical </b>measurement, it is not possible with any degree of certainty to provide precise, valid or reliable data about the extent of world-wide tourism participation or its <b>economic impact</b>. In many cases, similar difficulties arise when attempts are made to measure domestic tourism."]},{"name":"ARE/10-3-2","paragraph":["<h2>Autumn leaves</h2>","Canadian writer Jay Ingram investigates the<b> mystery </b>of why leaves turn red in the fall","<b>A.</b>   <b>One of the most</b> captivating natural events of the year in m<b>any areas</b> throughout <b>North America</b> is the turning of the leaves in the fall. The colours are magnificent, but the question of exactly why <b>some trees</b> turn yellow or orange, and others red or purple, is <b>something which has</b> long puzzled scientists.","<b>B.</b>   Summer leaves are green because they are full of chlorophyll, the<b> molecule </b>that captures sunlight converts that energy into <b>new building</b> materials for the tree. As fall approaches in the northern hemisphere, the amount of solar energy available declines considerably. For many trees – evergreen conifers being an exception – the best strategy is to abandon photosynthesis* until the spring. So rather than maintaining the now redundant leaves throughout the winter, the tree saves its <b>precious resources</b> and discards them. But before letting its leaves go, the tree dismantles their <b>chlorophyll molecules</b> and ships their valuable<b> nitrogen </b>back into the twigs. As<b> chlorophyll </b>is depleted, other colours that have been<b> dominated </b>by it throughout the summer begin to be revealed. This unmasking explains the autumn colours of yellow and orange, but not the brilliant reds and purples of trees such as the maple or sumac.","<b>C.</b>   The source of the red is widely known: it is created by anthocyanins, water-soluble plant<b> pigments </b>reflecting the red to blue range of the visible spectrum. They belong to a class of sugar-based <b>chemical compounds</b> <b>also known</b> as flavonoids. What’s puzzling is that<b> anthocyanins </b>are actually newly minted, made in the leaves at the <b>same time</b> as the tree is preparing to drop them. But it is hard to make sense of the manufacture of<b> anthocyanins </b>– why should a tree bother making <b>new chemicals</b> in its leaves when it’s already scrambling to<b> withdraw </b>and<b> preserve </b>the ones already there?","<b>D.</b>   Some theories about<b> anthocyanins </b>have argued that they might act as a chemical defence against attacks by insects or fungi, or that they might attract fruit-eating birds or increase a leaf’s tolerance to freezing. However, there are problems with each of these theories, including the fact that leaves are red for such a <b>relatively short</b> period that the expense of energy needed to manufacture the<b> anthocyanins </b>would outweigh any anti-fungal or anti-herbivore activity achieved.* photosynthesis: the production of new material from sunlight, water and <b>carbon dioxide</b>.","<b>E.</b>   It <b>has also</b> been proposed that trees may produce vivid red colours to convince herbivorous insects that they are healthy and robust and would be easily able to mount chemical defences against infestation. If insects paid attention to such advertisements, they might be prompted to lay their eggs on a duller, and<b> presumably </b>less<b> resistant </b>host. The<b> flaw </b>in this theory lies in the lack of proof to support it. No <b>one has</b> as yet ascertained whether more robust trees sport the brightest leaves, or whether insects make choices according to colour intensity.","<b>F.</b>   <b>Perhaps the most</b> plausible suggestion as to why leaves would go to the trouble of making<b> anthocyanins </b>when they’re busy packing up for the winter is the theory known as the ‘light screen’ hypothesis. It sounds paradoxical, because the idea behind this<b> hypothesis </b>is that the red<b> pigment </b>is made in autumn leaves to protect chlorophyll, the light-absorbing chemical, from <b>too much</b> light. Why does<b> chlorophyll </b>need protection when it is the <b>natural world</b>’s supreme light absorber? Why protect<b> chlorophyll </b>at a time when the tree is breaking it down to<b> salvage </b>as much of it as possible?","<b>G.</b>  Chlorophyll, although exquisitely evolved to capture the energy of sunlight, can sometimes be overwhelmed by it, especially in situations of drought, low temperatures, or nutrient deficiency. Moreover, the problem of oversensitivity to light is even more acute in the fall, when the leaf is busy preparing for winter by dismantling its internal machinery. The energy absorbed by the <b>chlorophyll molecules</b> of the unstable autumn leaf is not immediately channelled into useful products and processes, as it would be in an intact summer leaf. The weakened fall leaf then becomes<b> vulnerable </b>to the highly destructive effects of the<b> oxygen </b>created by the excited <b>chlorophyll molecules</b>.","<b>H.</b>  Even if you <b>had never</b> suspected that this is what was going on when leaves turn red, there are clues out there. One is straightforward: on many trees, the leaves that are the reddest are those on the side of the tree which gets most sun. Not only that, but the red is brighter on the upper side of the leaf. It <b>has also</b> been recognised for decades that the best conditions for intense red colours are dry, sunny days and cool nights, conditions that nicely match those that make leaves<b> susceptible </b>to excess light. And finally, trees such as maples usually get much redder the more north you travel in the northern hemisphere. It’s colder there, they’re more stressed, their<b> chlorophyll </b>is more sensitive and it needs more sunblock.","<b>I.</b>   What is still not fully understood, however, is why <b>some trees</b><b> resort </b>to producing red<b> pigments </b><b>while others</b> don’t bother, and simply reveal their orange or yellow hues. Do these <b>trees have</b> other means at their disposal to prevent overexposure to light in autumn? Their story, though not as<b> spectacular </b>to the eye, will surely turn out to be as subtle and as complex."]},{"name":"ARE/10-3-3","paragraph":["<h2>Beyond the blue horizon</h2>","An important archaeological discovery on the island of Efate in the Pacific<b> archipelago </b>of Vanuatu <b>has revealed</b> traces of an ancient seafaring people, the distant ancestors of todays, Polynesians. The site came to light only by chance. An agricultural worker,<b> digging </b>in the grounds of a<b> derelict </b>plantation,<b> scraped </b>open a grave – the first of dozens in a<b> burial </b>ground some 3,000 <b>years old</b>. It is the oldest<b> cemetery </b>ever found in the <b>Pacific island</b>s, and it harbors the remains of an <b>ancient people</b> archaeologists call the Lapita.","They were daring blue-water adventurers who used basic<b> canoes </b>to move across the ocean. But they were not just explorers. They were also pioneers who carried with them everything they would need to build new lives – their livestock, taro<b> seedlings </b>and stone tools. Within the span of several centuries, the Lapita stretched the boundaries of their world from the jungle-clad<b> volcanoes </b>of Papua <b>New Guinea</b> to the loneliest coral outliers of Tonga.","The Lapita left<b> precious </b>few clues about themselves, but Efate expands the volume of data available to researchers dramatically. The remains of 62 individuals have been uncovered so far, and archaeologists were also thrilled to find six complete Lapita pots. Other items included a Lapita<b> burial </b>urn with modeled birds arranged on the<b> rim </b>as though peering down at the <b>human remains</b><b> sealed </b>inside. ‘It’s an important discovery,’ says Matthew Spriggs, professor of archaeology at the <b>Australian National</b> University and head of the <b>international team</b><b> digging </b>up the site, ‘for it conclusively identifies the remains as Lapita.’","DNA teased from these <b>human remains</b> may help answer <b>one of the most</b> puzzling questions in Pacific anthropology: did all <b>Pacific island</b>ers spring from one source or many? Was there <b>only one</b><b> outward </b>migration from a single point in Asia, or several from different points? ‘This represents the best opportunity we’ve had yet,’ says Spriggs, ‘to find out who the Lapita actually were, where they came from, and who their closest<b> descendants </b>are today.’","There is one stubborn question for which archaeology has yet to provide any answers: how did the Lapita accomplish the ancient equivalent of a moon landing, m<b>any time</b>s over? No-one <b>has found</b> one of their<b> canoes </b>or any rigging, which could reveal how the<b> canoes </b>were sailed. Nor do the oral histories and traditions of later Polynesians offer any insights, for they turn into<b> myths </b>long before they reach as far <b>back in time</b> as the Lapita.","‘All we can say for certain is that the Lapita had<b> canoes </b>that were capable of ocean voyages, and they had the ability to sail them,’ says Geoff Irwin, a professor of archaeology at the University of Auckland. Those sailing skills, he says, were developed and <b>passed down</b> over <b>thousands of years</b> by earlier<b> mariners </b>who worked their way through the<b> archipelagoes </b>of the western Pacific, making short crossings to nearby islands. The real adventure didn’t begin, however, until their Lapita<b> descendants </b>sailed out of sight of land, with empty horizons on every side. This must have been as difficult for them as landing on the moon is for us today. Certainly, it distinguished them from their ancestors, but what gave them the courage to launch out on such risky voyages?","The Lap it as thrust into the Pacific was eastward, against the<b> prevailing </b><b>trade winds</b>, Irwin notes. Those nagging headwinds, he argues, may have been the key to their success. ‘They could sail out for days into the unknown and assess the area, secure in the knowledge that if they didn’t <b>find anything</b>, they could turn about and catch a<b> swift </b>ride back on the <b>trade winds</b>. This is what would <b>have made</b> the <b>whole thing</b> work.’ Once out there, skilled seafarers would have detected abundant leads to follow to land: seabirds, coconuts and<b> twigs </b>carried out to sea by the tides, and the afternoon pile-up of clouds on the horizon which often indicates an island in the distance.","For returning explorers, successful or not, the<b> geography </b>of their own<b> archipelagoes </b>would <b>have provided</b> a safety net. Without this to go by, overshooting their home ports, getting lost and sailing off into eternity would have been <b>all too</b> easy. Vanuatu, for example, stretches more than 500 miles in a northwest-southeast trend, its scores of inrervisible islands forming a backstop for<b> mariners </b>riding the <b>trade winds</b> home.","All this presupposes one essential detail, says Atholl Anderson, professor of prehistory at the <b>Australian National</b> University: the Lapita had mastered the advanced art of sailing against the wind. ‘And there’s no proof they could <b>do any</b> such thing,’ Anderson says. ‘There has been this assumption they did, and <b>people have</b> <b>built canoes</b> to re-create those early<b> voyages </b>based on that assumption. But nobody has <b>any idea</b> what their<b> canoes </b><b>looked like</b> or how they were rigged.’","Rather than give all the credit to human skill, Anderson invokes the winds of chance. El Nino, the same climate<b> disruption </b>that affects the Pacific today, may have helped<b> scatter </b>the Lapita, Anderson suggests. He points out that climate data obtained from slow-growing corals around the Pacific indicate a series of<b> unusually </b>frequent El Ninos around the time of the Lapita expansion. By reversing the regular east-to-west flow of the <b>trade winds</b> for weeks at a time, these super El Ninos might <b>have taken</b> the Lapita on long<b> unplanned </b>voyages.","However they did it, the Lapita spread themselves a third of the way across the Pacific, then called it quits for reasons known only to them. Ahead lay the vast emptiness of the central Pacific and perhaps they were too thinly stretched to venture farther. They probably never numbered more than a few thousand in total, and in their rapid migration<b> eastward </b>they encountered hundreds of islands – more than 300 in Fiji alone."]},{"name":"ARE/10-4-1","paragraph":["<h2>The Megafires of California</h2>","Drought, housing expansion, and oversupply of tinder make for  bigger, hotter fires in the western <b>United States</b>","Wildfires are <b>becoming an increasing</b><b> menace </b>in the western <b>United States</b>, with <b>Southern California</b> being the hardest hit area. There’s a reason fire squads battling more frequent<b> blazes </b>in <b>Southern California</b> are having such difficulty containing the flames, despite better<b> preparedness </b>than ever and decades of experience fighting fires fanned by the ‘Santa Ana Winds’. The wildfires themselves, experts say, are generally hotter, faster, and spread more erratically than in the past.","Megafires, <b>also called</b> ‘siege fires’, are the increasingly frequent<b> blazes </b>that burn 500,000 acres or more – 10 times the size of the average forest fire of 20 <b>years ago</b>. <b>Some recent</b> wildfires are among the biggest ever in California in terms of acreage burned, according to state figures and news reports.","One explanation for the trend to more superhot fires is that the region, which usually has dry summers, <b>has had</b> significantly below normal<b> precipitation </b>in many <b>recent years</b>. <b>Another reason</b>, experts say, is related to the century- long policy of the US Forest Service to stop wildfires as quickly as possible. The unintentional consequence has been to halt the natural<b> eradication </b>of underbrush, now the primary<b> fuel </b>for megafires.","Three other factors contribute to the trend, they add. First is <b>climate change</b>, marked by a 1-degree Fahrenheit rise in average yearly<b> temperature </b>across the western states. Second is fire seasons that on average are 78 days longer than they were 20 <b>years ago</b>. Third is increased construction of homes in wooded areas.","‘We are increasingly building our homes in fire-prone ecosystems,’ says Dominik Kulakowski, adjunct professor of biology at Clark University Graduate School of<b> Geography </b>in Worcester, Massachusetts. ‘Doing that in many of the forests of the western US is <b>like building</b> homes on the side of an active volcano.’","In California, where <b>population growth</b> has averaged more than 600,000 a year for at least a decade, more<b> residential </b>housing is being built. ‘ What once was open space is now<b> residential </b>homes providing<b> fuel </b>to make fires burn with greater intensity,’ says Terry McHale of the California Department of<b> Forestry </b>firefighters’ union. ‘With so  much dryness, so many communities to catch fire, so many fronts to fight, it becomes an almost incredible job.’","That said, many experts give California high marks for making progress on<b> preparedness </b>in <b>recent years</b>, after some of the largest fires in state history scorched thousands of acres, burned thousands of homes, and killed<b> numerous </b>people. Stung in the past by criticism of bungling that allowed fires to spread when they might have been contained,<b> personnel </b>are meeting the<b> peculiar </b>challenges of<b> neighborhood </b>– and canyon- hopping fires better than previously, observers say.","State promises to provide more up-to-date engines, planes, and helicopters to fight fires have been fulfilled. Firefighters’ unions that in the past complained of dilapidated equipment, old fire engines, and insufficient blueprints for fire safety are now praising the state’s commitment, noting that funding for firefighting <b>has increased</b>, despite huge cuts in <b>m<b>any other</b></b> programs. ‘We are pleased that the current state administration has been very<b> proactive </b>in its support of us, and [has] come through with budgetary support of the infrastructure needs we <b>have long</b> sought,’ says Mr. McHale of the firefighters’ union.","Besides providing money to upgrade the fire engines that must traverse the<b> mammoth </b>state and wind along serpentine<b> canyon </b>roads, the state has invested in better command-and-control<b> facilities </b>as well as in the strategies to run them. ‘In the fire sieges of earlier years, we found that other<b> jurisdictions </b>and states were willing to offer mutual-aid help, but we were not able to communicate adequately with them,’ says Kim Zagaris, chief of the state’s Office of<b> Emergency </b>Services Fire and Rescue Branch.","After a<b> commission </b>examined and revamped communications procedures, the statewide response ‘<b>has become</b> far more professional and responsive,’ he says. There is a sense among both <b>government officials</b> and<b> residents </b>that the speed, dedication, and coordination of firefighters from several states and<b> jurisdictions </b>are resulting in greater efficiency than in past ‘siege fire’ situations.","In <b>recent years</b>, the <b>Southern California</b> region has <b>improved building</b> codes, evacuation procedures, and<b> procurement </b>of <b>new technology</b>. ‘I am extraordinarily impressed by the improvements we have witnessed,’ says Randy Jacobs, a <b>Southern California</b>- based lawyer who <b>has had</b> to evacuate both his home and business to escape wildfires.‘ Notwithstanding all the damage that will continue to be caused by wildfires, we will <b>no longer</b> suffer the loss of life endured in the <b>past because</b> of the fire prevention and firefighting measures that have been put in place, ’ he says."]},{"name":"ARE/10-4-2","paragraph":["<h2>Second Nature</h2>","Your personality isn’t necessarily set in stone.

The <b>good news</b> is that all this can be learned.","Some qualities are less challenging to develop than others,<b> optimism </b>being one of them. However, developing qualities requires mastering a range of skills which are diverse and sometimes surprising.

Inherently introverted, he realised early on that as an academic, his reticence would prove<b> disastrous </b>in the lecture hall. So he learned to be more outgoing and to entertain his classes. ‘Now my extroverted behaviour is spontaneous, ‘ he says.","<b>C </b> David Fajgenbaum <b>had to make</b> a similar transition.

She recommends you train yourself to pay attention to good fortune by <b>writing down</b> three <b>positive things</b> that come about <b>each day</b>. This will help you convince yourself that favourable outcomes actually happen <b>all the time</b>, making it easier to begin taking action.","<b>E </b> You can recognise a person who is passionate about a pursuit by the way they are so strongly involved in it.

The physical<b> stamina </b>required for this sport is intense but the<b> psychological </b>demands are even more overwhelming.

The secret about consuming passions, though, according to<b> psychologist </b>Paul Silvia of the University of North Carolina, is that ‘they require discipline, <b>hard work</b> and ability, which is why they are so rewarding.’<b> Psychologist </b>Todd Kashdan has this advice for those people taking up a new passion: ‘ As a newcomer, you <b>also have</b> to tolerate and laugh at your own ignorance. You must be willing to accept the negative feelings that come your way,’ he says.","<b>G </b> In 2004, physician-scientist Mauro Zappaterra began his PhD research at Harvard <b>Medical School</b>.

He finally took a break and during eight months in Santa Fe, Zappaterra learned about alternative healing techniques not taught at Harvard. When he <b>got back</b>, he switched labs to study how cerebrospinal fluid nourishes the developing nervous system. He also vowed to look for the joy in everything, including failure, as this could help him learn about his research and himself.","<b>One thing</b> that can hold joy back is a person’s<b> concentration </b>on avoiding failure rather than their <b>looking forward</b> to <b><b>doing some</b>thing</b> well. ‘Focusing on being safe might <b>get in the way</b> of your reaching your goals,’ explains Kashdan. For example, are you <b>hoping to get</b> through a business lunch without embarrassing yourself, or are you thinking about how fascinating the conversation might be?","<b>H </b> Usually, we think of courage in physical terms but ordinary life demands something else. For marketing executive Kenneth Pedeleose, it meant speaking out against something he thought was ethically wrong. The new manager was<b> intimidating </b>staff so Pedeleose carefully recorded each instance of bullying and eventually took the evidence to a senior director, knowing his own <b>job security</b> would be threatened. Eventually, the manager was the one to go. According to Cynthia Pury, a<b> psychologist </b>at Clemson University, Pedeleose’s story proves the point that courage is not motivated by fearlessness, but by moral obligation.

For the better part of a century, most biologists have been<b> reluctant </b>to use those words, mindful of a<b> principle </b>of evolution that says ‘evolution cannot <b>run backwards</b>. But as more and more examples come to light and modern genetics enters the scene, that<b> principle </b>is having to be rewritten. Not only are evolutionary throwbacks possible, they sometimes play an <b>important role</b> in the forward march of evolution.","The technical term for an evolutionary throwback is an ‘atavism’, from the Latin atavus, meaning forefather. The word has ugly connotations thanks largely to Cesare Lombroso, a 19th-century Italian medic who argued that criminals were born not made and could be identified by certain physical features that were throwbacks to a primitive, sub-human state.","While Lombroso was measuring criminals, a Belgian palaeontologist called Louis Dollo was studying<b> fossil </b>records and coming to the<b> opposite </b>conclusion. In 1890 he proposed that evolution was irreversible: that ‘an organism is unable to return, even partially, to a previous stage already realised in the ranks of its ancestors. Early 20th-century biologists came to a similar conclusion, though they qualified it in terms of probability, stating that there is no reason why evolution cannot <b>run backwards</b> -it is just very unlikely. And so the idea of irreversibility in evolution<b> stuck </b>and came to be known as ‘Dollo’s law.","If Dollo’s law is right, atavisms should occur only very rarely, if at all. Y<b>et al</b>most since the idea took root, exceptions have been cropping up. In 1919, for example, a humpback whale with a pair of leglike appendages over a metre long, complete with a full set of<b> limb </b>bones, was caught off Vancouver Island in Canada.<b> Explorer </b>Roy Chapman Andrews argued at the time that the whale must be a throwback to a land-living ancestor. ‘I can see <b>no other</b> explanation, he wrote in 1921.","Since then, so <b>m<b>any other</b></b> examples have been discovered that it <b>no longer</b> <b>makes sense</b> to say that evolution is as good as irreversible. And this poses a puzzle: how can characteristics that disappeared <b>millions of years</b> ago suddenly reappear? In 1994, Rudolf Raff and colleagues at Indiana University in the USA <b>decided to use</b> genetics to put a number on the probability of evolution going into reverse. They reasoned that <b>while some</b> evolutionary changes involve the loss of genes and are therefore irreversible, others may be the result of genes being switched off. If these <b>silent genes</b> are somehow switched back on, they argued, long lost traits could reappear.","Raff’s team went on to calculate the<b> likelihood </b>of it happening. <b>Silent genes</b> accumulate random mutations, they reasoned, eventually rendering them useless. So how long can a gene survive in a<b> species </b>if it is <b>no longer</b> used? The team calculated that there is a <b>good chance</b> of <b>silent genes</b> surviving for up to 6 <b>million years</b> in at least a few individuals in a population, and that some might <b>survive as long</b> as 10 <b>million years</b>. In other words, throwbacks are possible, but only to the relatively recent evolutionary past.","As a possible example, the team pointed to the mole<b> salamanders </b>of Mexico and California. Like most amphibians these begin life in a<b> juvenile </b>‘tadpole’ state, then<b> metamorphose </b>into the adult form – <b>except for one</b> species, the axolotl, which famously lives its entire life as a juvenile. The<b> simplest </b>explanation for this is that the<b> axolotl </b>lineage alone <b>lost the ability</b> to metamorphose, <b>while others</b> retained it. From a detailed analysis of the salamanders’ family tree, however, it is clear that the other<b> lineages </b>evolved from an ancestor that itself <b>had <b>lost the ability</b></b> to metamorphose. In other words, metamorphosis in mole<b> salamanders </b>is an atavism. The salamander example fits with Raff’s 10 million-year time frame.","More recently, however, examples have been reported that break the time limit, suggesting that <b>silent genes</b> may not be the whole story. In a paper published <b>last year</b>, biologist Gunter Wagner of Yale University reported some work on the evolutionary history of a group of <b><b>South America</b>n</b><b> lizards </b>called Bachia. Many of these have minuscule limbs; some look more like snakes than<b> lizards </b>and a few have completely lost the<b> toes </b>on their<b> hind </b>limbs. <b>Other species</b>, however, sport <b>up to four</b><b> toes </b>on their<b> hind </b>legs. The<b> simplest </b>explanation is that the toed<b> lineages </b>never lost their toes, but Wagner begs to differ. According to his analysis of the Bachia family tree, the toed<b> species </b>re-evolved<b> toes </b>from toeless ancestors and, what is more, digit loss and gain has<b> occurred </b>on more than one occasion over tens of <b>millions of years</b>.","So what’s going on? <b>One possibility</b> is that these traits are lost and then simply reappear, in much the same way that similar structures can independently arise in<b> unrelated </b>species, such as the<b> dorsal </b>fins of sharks and killer whales. Another more<b> intriguing </b>possibility is that the genetic information needed to make<b> toes </b>somehow survived for tens or perhaps hundreds of <b>millions of years</b> in the<b> lizards </b>and was reactivated. These atavistic traits provided an advantage and spread through the population, effectively reversing evolution.","But if <b>silent genes</b> degrade within 6 to <b>million years</b>, how can long-lost traits be reactivated over longer timescales? The answer may lie in the womb. Early embryos of <b>many species</b> develop<b> ancestral </b>features. Snake embryos, for example, sprout<b> hind </b>limb buds. Later in development these features disappear thanks to developmental programs that say ‘lose the leg’.

Applying the most conservative<b> estimates </b>to current<b> demographic </b>trends, the human population will increase by about three billion people by then. An<b> estimated </b>109<b> hectares </b>of new land (about 20% larger than Brazil) will be needed to <b>grow enough</b> <b>food to feed</b> them, if traditional farming methods continue as they are practised today. At present, throughout the world, over 80% of the land that is suitable for raising crops is in use. Historically, some 15% of that has been<b> laid </b>waste by poor management practices. What can be done to ensure <b>enough food</b> for the world’s population to live on?","The concept of indoor farming is not new, since hothouse production of tomatoes and other produce has been in vogue for <b>some time</b>. What is new is the urgent need to scale up this technology to accommodate another three billion people. Many believe an entirely new approach to indoor farming is required, employing cutting-edge technologies. <b>One such</b> proposal is for the “Vertical Farm”. The concept is of multi-storey buildings in which food crops are grown in environmentally controlled conditions.","Situated in the heart of urban centres, they would<b> drastically </b><b>reduce the amount</b> of transportation required to bring food to consumers. Vertical farms would need to be efficient, cheap to construct and safe to operate. If successfully implemented, proponents claim, vertical farms offer the promise of urban renewal,<b> sustainable </b>production of a safe and varied food supply (through year-round production of all crops), and the eventual repair of ecosystems that have been<b> sacrificed </b>for horizontal farming.","It took humans 10,000 years to learn how to grow most of the crops we now take for granted. Along the way, we despoiled most of the land we worked, often turning verdant, natural ecozones into semi-arid deserts. Within that <b>same time</b> frame, we evolved into an urban species, in which 60% of the human population now lives vertically in cities. This means that, for the majority, we <b>humans have</b> shelter from the elements, yet we subject our food-bearing plants to the<b> rigours </b>of the great outdoors and can do no more than hope for a good weather year.","However, more often than not now, due to a rapidly changing climate, that is not what happens. Massive floods, long droughts, hurricanes and severe<b> monsoons </b>take their toll <b>each year</b>, destroying millions of tons of valuable crops.","The supporters of <b>vertical farming</b> claim many potential advantages for the system. For instance, crops would be produced <b>all <b>year round</b></b>, as they would be kept in artificially controlled,<b> optimum </b>growing conditions. There would be no weather-related crop failures due to droughts, floods or pests. <b>All the food</b> could be grown organically, eliminating the need for herbicides, pesticides and fertilisers. The system would greatly reduce the incidence of many infectious diseases that are acquired at the agricultural interface.","Although the system would consume energy, it would return energy to the grid via methane generation from<b> composting </b>non-¬edible parts of plants. It would also <b>dramatically reduce</b><b> fossil </b>fuel use, by cutting out the need for tractors, ploughs and shipping.","<b>A </b> major drawback of <b>vertical farming</b>, however, is that the plants would require artificial light. Without it, those plants nearest the windows would be exposed to more sunlight and grow more quickly, reducing the efficiency of the system. Single-storey greenhouses have the benefit of natural overhead light: even so, many still need artificial lighting. A multi-storey<b> facility </b>with <b>no natural</b> overhead light would require far more. Generating enough light could be<b> prohibitively </b>expensive, unless cheap, <b>renewable energy</b> is available, and this appears to be rather a future aspiration than a<b> likelihood </b>for the near future.","One variation on <b>vertical farming</b> that has been developed is to grow plants in stacked<b> trays </b>that move on rails. Moving the<b> trays </b>allows the plants to get enough sunlight. This system is already in operation, and <b>works well</b> within a single-storey greenhouse with light reaching it from above: it is not certain, however, that it can be made to work without that overhead natural light.","<b>Vertical farming</b> is an attempt to address the undoubted problems that we face in <b>producing enough</b> food for a growing population. At the moment, though, more needs to be done to reduce the<b> detrimental </b>impact it would have on the environment, particularly as regards the use of energy. While it is possible that much of our food will be grown in<b> skyscrapers </b>in future, most experts currently believe it is far more likely that we will simply use the space available on urban rooftops."]},{"name":"ARE/11-1-2","paragraph":["<h2>The Falkirk Wheel</h2>","<b>A </b> unique engineering achievement !!!","The <b>Falkirk Wheel</b> in Scotland is the world’s first and only rotating boat lift. Opened in 2002, it is central to the ambitious £84.5m<b> Millennium </b>Link project to restore navigability across Scotland by reconnecting the historic waterways of the Forth & Clyde and <b>Union Canal</b>s.","The major challenge of the project lays in the fact that the Forth & Clyde Canal is situated 35 metres below the level of the <b>Union Canal</b>. Historically, the two canals had been joined near the town of Falkirk by a sequence of 11 locks – enclosed sections of canal in which the water level could be raised or lowered – that stepped down across a distance of 1.5 km. This had been<b> dismantled </b>in 1933, thereby breaking the link. When the project was launched in 1994, the British Waterways authority were keen to create a dramatic twenty-first-century landmark which would not only be a fitting commemoration of the Millennium, but also a lasting symbol of the economic<b> regeneration </b>of the region.","Numerous ideas were submitted for the project, including concepts ranging from rolling eggs to tilting tanks, from giant seesaws to overhead monorails. The eventual winner was a plan for the huge rotating<b> steel </b>boat lift which was to become The <b>Falkirk Wheel</b>. The unique shape of the structure is claimed to have been inspired by various sources, both manmade and natural, most notably a Celtic double headed axe, but also the vast turning propeller of a ship, the ribcage of a whale or the<b> spine </b>of a fish.","The various parts of The <b>Falkirk Wheel</b> were all constructed and assembled, like one giant toy building set, at Butterley Engineering’s Steelworks in Derbyshire, some 400 km from Falkirk. A team there carefully assembled the 1,200 tonnes of steel, painstakingly fitting the pieces together to an accuracy of just 10 mm to ensure a perfect final fit. In the summer of 2001, the structure was then<b> dismantled </b>and transported on 35<b> lorries </b>to Falkirk, before all being<b> bolted </b>back together again on the ground, and finally lifted into position in five large sections by crane. The Wheel would need to<b> withstand </b>immense and <b>constantly changing</b> stresses as it rotated, so to make the structure more robust, the<b> steel </b>sections were<b> bolted </b>rather than welded together. Over 45,000<b> bolt </b>holes were matched with their bolts, and each<b> bolt </b>was hand-tightened.","The Wheel consists of two sets of<b> opposing </b>axe-shaped arms, attached about 25 metres apart to a fixed central spine. Two<b> diametrically </b>opposed water-filled ‘gondolas’, each with a capacity of 360,000 litres, are fitted between the ends of the arms. These<b> gondolas </b>always weigh the same, whether or not they are carrying boats. This is because, according to Archimedes’<b> principle </b>of displacement, floating objects displace their own weight in water. So when a boat enters a gondola, the amount of water leaving the<b> gondola </b>weighs <b>exactly the same</b> as the boat. This keeps the Wheel balanced and so, despite its enormous mass, it rotates through 180° in five and a half minutes while using <b>very little</b> power. It takes just 1.5 kilowatt-hours (5.4 MJ) of energy to rotate the Wheel -roughly the same as boiling eight small domestic kettles of water.","Boats needing to be lifted up enter the <b>canal basin</b> at the level of the Forth & Clyde Canal and then enter the lower<b> gondola </b>of the Wheel. Two<b> hydraulic </b>steel gates are raised, so as to<b> seal </b>the<b> gondola </b>off from the water in the <b>canal basin</b>. The water between the gates is then<b> pumped </b>out. A<b> hydraulic </b>clamp, which prevents the arms of the Wheel moving while the<b> gondola </b>is docked, is removed, allowing the Wheel to turn. In the central machine room, an array of ten<b> hydraulic </b>motors then begins to rotate the central axle. The<b> axle </b>connects to the outer arms of the Wheel, which begin to rotate at a speed of 1/8 of a revolution <b>per minute</b>. As the wheel rotates, the<b> gondolas </b>are kept in the upright position by a simple<b> gearing </b>system. Two eight-metre-wide<b> cogs </b>orbit a fixed inner cog of the same width, connected by two smaller<b> cogs </b>travelling in the <b>opposite direction</b> to the outer<b> cogs </b>– so ensuring that the<b> gondolas </b>always remain level. When the<b> gondola </b>reaches the top, the boat passes<b> straight </b>onto the<b> aqueduct </b>situated 24 metres above the <b>canal basin</b>.","The remaining 11 metres of lift needed to reach the <b>Union Canal</b> is achieved by means of a pair of locks. The Wheel could not be constructed to elevate boats over the full 35-metre difference between the two canals, owing to the presence of the historically important Antonine Wall, which was <b>built by the Romans</b> in the <b>second century</b> AD. Boats travel under this wall via a tunnel, then through the locks, and finally on to the <b>Union Canal</b>."]},{"name":"ARE/11-1-3","paragraph":["<h2>Reducing the Effects of Climate Change</h2>","Mark Rowe reports on the increasingly ambitious geo-engineering projects  being explored by scientists","<b>A</b>","Such is our dependence on<b> fossil </b>fuels, and such is the volume of <b>carbon dioxide</b> already released into the atmosphere, that many experts agree that significant <b>global warming</b> is now inevitable. They believe that the best we can do is keep it at a reasonable level, and at present, the only serious option for doing this is cutting back on our <b>carbon emissions</b>. But <b>while a few</b> countries are making major strides in this regard, the majority are having great difficulty even stemming the rate of increase, l<b>et al</b>one reversing it. Consequently, an <b>increasing number</b> of scientists are beginning to explore the alternative of geo-engineering — a term which generally<b> refers </b>to the intentional large-scale manipulation of the environment. According to its proponents, geo-engineering is the equivalent of a backup generator: if Plan A – reducing our dependency on<b> fossil </b>fuels – fails, we require a Plan B, employing grand schemes to <b>slow down</b> or reverse the process of <b>global warming</b>.","<b>B</b>","Geo-engineering; has been shown to work, at least on a small localised scale. For decades, MayDay parades in Moscow <b>have <b>taken place</b></b> under clear blue skies, aircraft having deposited dry ice, silver iodide and<b> cement </b>powder to disperse clouds. Many of the schemes now suggested look to do the opposite, and <b>reduce the amount</b> of sunlight reaching the planet. The most eye-catching idea of all is suggested by Professor Roger Angel of the University of Arizona. His scheme would employ up to 16 trillion minute spacecraft, each weighing about one gram, to form a transparent, sunlight-refracting<b> sunshade </b>in an orbit 1.5 million km above the Earth. This could, argues Angel, <b>reduce the amount</b> of light reaching the Earth by two <b>per cent</b>.","<b>C</b>","The majority of geo-engineering projects so far carried out — which include planting forests in<b> deserts </b>and depositing iron in the ocean to<b> stimulate </b>the growth of algae – <b>have focused</b> on achieving a general cooling of the Earth. But some look specifically at reversing the melting at the poles, particularly the Arctic. The reasoning is that if you replenish the ice sheets and frozen<b> waters </b>of the high latitudes, more light will be reflected back into space, so reducing the warming of the oceans and atmosphere.","<b>D</b>","The concept of releasing aerosol sprays into the stratosphere above the Arctic has been proposed by several scientists. This would involve using<b> sulphur </b>or hydrogen sulphide aerosols so that sulphur<b> dioxide </b>would form clouds, which would, in turn, lead to a global dimming. The idea is modelled on historic<b> volcanic </b>explosions, such as that of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991, which led to a short-term cooling of <b>global temperatures</b> by 0.5 °C. <b>Scientists have</b> also scrutinised whether it’s possible to<b> preserve </b>the ice sheets of Greenland with reinforced high-tension cables, preventing icebergs from moving into the sea. Meanwhile, in the Russian Arctic, geo-engineering plans include the planting of millions of birch trees. Whereas the -regions native evergreen pines shade the snow an absorb radiation, birches would<b> shed </b>their leaves in winter, thus enabling<b> radiation </b>to be reflected by the snow. Re-routing Russian rivers to increase <b>cold water</b> flow to ice-forming areas could also be <b>used to slow</b> down warming, say some climate scientists.","<b>E</b>","But will such schemes ever be implemented? Generally speaking, those who are most cautious about geo-engineering are the scientists involved in the research. Angel says that his plan is ‘no<b> substitute </b>for developing <b>renewable energy</b>: the only permanent solution’. And Dr Phil Rasch of the US-based Pacific Northwest National<b> Laboratory </b>is equally guarded about the role of geo-engineering: ‘I think all of us agree that if we were to end geo-engineering on a given day, then the planet would return to its pre-engineered condition very rapidly, and probably within ten to twenty years. That’s certainly something to worry about.’","<b>F</b>","The US National Center for<b> Atmospheric </b><b>Research has</b> already suggested that the proposal to inject<b> sulphur </b>into the atmosphere might affect<b> rainfall </b>patterns across the tropics and the Southern Ocean. ‘Geo-engineering plans to inject stratospheric aerosols or to seed clouds would act to cool the planet, and act to increase the extent of sea ice,’ says Rasch. ‘But all the models <b>suggest some</b> impact on the distribution of precipitation.’","<b>G</b>","<b>A </b> further risk with geo-engineering projects is that you can “overshoot Y says Dr Dan Hunt, from the University of Bristol’s School of Geophysical Sciences, who has studied the likely impacts of the<b> sunshade </b>and aerosol schemes on the climate. ‘You may bring <b>global temperatures</b> back to pre-industrial levels, but the risk is that the poles will still be warmer than they should be and the tropics will be cooler than before industrialisation.’To avoid such a scenario,” Hunt says, “Angel’s project would have to operate at half strength; all of which reinforces his view that the best option is to avoid the need for geo-engineering altogether.”","<b>H</b>","The <b>main reason</b> why geo-engineering is supported by many in the <b>scientific community</b> is that <b>most researchers</b> have little faith in the ability of<b> politicians </b>to agree – and then bring in — the necessary carbon cuts. <b>Even lead</b>ing conservation organisations see the value of investigating the potential of geo-engineering.

Among the English<b> vessels </b>was a warship by the name of <b>Mary Rose</b>. Built in Portsmouth some 35 years earlier, she <b>had had</b> a long and successful fighting career, and was a favourite of King Henry VIII. Accounts of what happened to the<b> ship </b>vary: while witnesses agree that she was not hit by the French, some maintain that she was outdated, overladen and sailing too low in the water, others that she was mishandled by undisciplined crew. What is undisputed, however, is that the <b>Mary Rose</b> sank into the Solent that day, taking at least 500 men with her. After the battle, <b>attempts were made</b> to recover the ship, but these failed.","The <b>Mary Rose</b> came to rest on the seabed, lying on her<b> starboard </b>(right) side at an angle of approximately 60 degrees. The<b> hull </b>(the body of the ship) acted as a trap for the sand and mud carried by Solent currents. As a result, the<b> starboard </b>side filled rapidly, leaving the exposed port (left) side to be eroded by marine organisms and mechanical degradation. Because of the way the<b> ship </b>sank, <b>nearly all</b> of the<b> starboard </b>half survived intact. During the seventeenth and<b> eighteenth </b>centuries, the entire site became covered with a layer of hard grey clay, which minimised further erosion.","Then, on 16 June 1836, some fishermen in the Solent found that their equipment was caught on an underwater obstruction, which turned out to be the <b>Mary Rose</b>. Diver John Deane happened to be<b> exploring </b>another<b> sunken </b>ship nearby, and the fishermen approached him, asking him to free their gear. Deane dived down, and found the equipment caught on a<b> timber </b>protruding slightly from the seabed.<b> Exploring </b>further, he uncovered several other<b> timbers </b>and a bronze gun. Deane continued diving on the site intermittently until 1840, recovering several more guns, two bows, various timbers, part of a pump and various other small finds.","The <b>Mary Rose</b> then faded into obscurity for another <b>hundred years</b>. But in 1965, military historian and amateur diver Alexander McKee, in conjunction with the British Sub-Aqua Club, initiated a <b>project called</b> ‘Solent Ships’. While on paper this was a plan to examine a number of known<b> wrecks </b>in the Solent, what McKee really hoped for was to find the <b>Mary Rose</b>. Ordinary search techniques proved unsatisfactory, so McKee entered into collaboration with Harold E. Edgerton, professor of electrical engineering at the Massachusetts <b>Institute of Technology</b>. In 1967, Edgerton’s side-scan<b> sonar </b>systems revealed a large,<b> unusually </b>shaped object, which McKee believed was the <b>Mary Rose</b>.","Further excavations revealed<b> stray </b>pieces of<b> timber </b>and an iron gun. But the climax to the operation came when, on 5 May 1971, part of the ship’s frame was uncovered. McKee and his team now knew for certain that they <b>had found</b> the wreck, but were as yet unaware that it also housed a <b>treasure trove</b> of beautifully<b> preserved </b>artefacts. Interest in the project grew, and in 1979, The <b>Mary Rose</b> Trust was formed, with Prince Charles as its President and Dr Margaret Rule its Archaeological Director.","The decision whether or not to<b> salvage </b>the<b> wreck </b>was not an easy one, although an<b> excavation </b>in 1978 had shown that it might be possible to raise the hull. While the original aim was to raise the<b> hull </b>if at all feasible, the operation was not given the go-ahead until January 1982, when all the necessary information was available.","An <b>important factor</b> in trying to<b> salvage </b>the <b>Mary Rose</b> was that the remaining<b> hull </b>was an open shell. This led to an important decision being taken: namely to carry out the lifting operation in three very distinct stages. The<b> hull </b>was attached to a <b>lifting frame</b> via a network of<b> bolts </b>and lifting wires. The problem of the<b> hull </b>being sucked back downwards into the mud was overcome by using 12<b> hydraulic </b>jacks. These raised it a <b>few centimetres</b> over a period of several days, as the <b>lifting frame</b> rose slowly up its four legs.","It was only when the<b> hull </b>was hanging freely from the <b>lifting frame</b>, clear of the<b> seabed </b>and the suction effect of the surrounding mud, that the<b> salvage </b>operation progressed to the second stage. In this stage, the <b>lifting frame</b> was fixed to a<b> hook </b>attached to a crane, and the<b> hull </b>was lifted completely clear of the<b> seabed </b>and<b> transferred </b>underwater into the <b>lifting cradle</b>. This required precise positioning to locate the legs into the stabbing guides’ of the <b>lifting cradle</b>.","The <b>lifting cradle</b> was designed to fit the<b> hull </b>using <b>archaeological survey</b> drawings, and was fitted with air bags to provide additional cushioning for the hull’s delicate<b> timber </b>framework. The third and <b>final stage</b> was to lift the entire structure into the air, by which time the<b> hull </b>was also supported from below. Finally, on 11 October 1982, millions of people a<b>round the world</b> held their<b> breath </b>as the<b> timber </b>skeleton of the <b>Mary Rose</b> was lifted clear of the water, ready to be returned home to Portsmouth."]},{"name":"ARE/11-2-2","paragraph":["<h2>What destroyed the civilisation of Easter Island?</h2>","<b>A</b>","<b>Easter Island</b>, or Rapu Nui as it is known locally, is home to several hundred ancient human<b> statues </b>– the moai. After this remote <b>Pacific island</b> was settled by the Polynesians, it remained isolated for centuries. All the energy and resources that went into the<b> moai </b>– some of which are <b>ten metres</b> tall and weigh over 7,000<b> kilos </b>– came from the island itself. Yet when Dutch<b> explorers </b>landed in 1722, they met a Stone Age culture. The<b> moai </b>were carved with stone tools, then transported for many kilometres, without the use of animals or wheels, to massive stone platforms. The identity of the <b>moai builders</b> was in doubt until well into the <b>twentieth century</b>. <b>Thor Heyerdahl</b>, the Norwegian ethnographer and adventurer, thought the<b> statues </b>had been created by pre-Inca peoples from Peru. Bestselling Swiss author Erich von Daniken believed they were built by stranded extraterrestrials. Modern science – linguistic, archaeological and genetic evidence – has<b> definitively </b>proved the <b>moai builders</b> were Polynesians, but not how they moved their creations. Local folklore maintains that the<b> statues </b>walked, while <b>researchers have</b> tended to assume the ancestors dragged the<b> statues </b>somehow, using ropes and logs.","<b>B</b>","When the <b>Europeans arrived</b>, Rapa Nui was grassland, with <b>only a few</b> scrawny trees. In the 1970s and 1980s, though, researchers found pollen<b> preserved </b>in lake sediments, which proved the island had been covered in<b> lush </b>palm forests for <b>thousands of years</b>. Only after the Polynesians arrived did those forests disappear. US scientist Jared Diamond believes that the Rapanui people –<b> descendants </b>of Polynesian settlers – wrecked their own environment. They had unfortunately settled on an extremely fragile island – dry, cool, and too remote to be properly<b> fertilised </b>by<b> windblown </b><b>volcanic ash</b>. When the islanders cleared the forests for firewood and farming, the forests didn’t grow back. As trees became<b> scarce </b>and they could <b>no longer</b> construct wooden<b> canoes </b>for fishing, they ate birds. Soil erosion decreased their <b>crop yields</b>. Before <b>Europeans arrived</b>, the Rapanui had descended into <b>civil war</b> and cannibalism, he maintains. The collapse of their isolated civilisation, Diamond writes, is a ’worst-case<b> scenario </b>for what may lie ahead of us in our own future’.","<b>C</b>","The moai, he thinks, accelerated the self-destruction. Diamond interprets them as power displays by<b> rival </b>chieftains who, trapped on a remote little island, lacked <b>other ways</b> of asserting their dominance. They competed by building ever bigger figures. Diamond thinks they<b> laid </b>the<b> moai </b>on wooden sledges, hauled over log rails, but that required both a lot of wood and a <b>lot of people</b>. To feed the people, even more land had to be cleared. When the wood was gone and <b>civil war</b> began, the islanders began toppling the moai. By the <b>nineteenth century</b> none were standing.","<b>D</b>","Archaeologists Terry Hunt of the University of Hawaii and Carl Lipo of California <b>State University</b> agree that <b>Easter Island</b> lost its<b> lush </b>forests and that it was an ‘ecological catastrophe’ – but they believe the islanders themselves weren’t to blame. And the<b> moai </b>certainly weren’t. Archaeological excavations indicate that the Rapanui went to heroic efforts to protect the resources of their wind-lashed, infertile fields. They built thousands of circular stone windbreaks and gardened inside them, and used broken<b> volcanic </b>rocks to keep the soil moist. In short, <b>Hunt and Lipo</b> argue, the<b> prehistoric </b>Rapanui were pioneers of<b> sustainable </b>farming.","<b>E</b>","<b>Hunt and Lipo</b> contend that moai-building was an activity that helped keep the peace between islanders.  They also believe that moving the<b> moai </b>required <b>few people</b> and no wood, because they were walked upright. On that issue, <b>Hunt and Lipo</b> say, archaeological evidence backs up Rapanui folklore. Recent experiments indicate that as few as 18 people could, with three strong ropes and a bit of practice, easily<b> manoeuvre </b>a 1,000 kg<b> moai </b>replica a few hundred metres. The figures’ fat<b> bellies </b>tilted them forward, and a D-shaped base allowed handlers to roll and rock them side to side.","<b>F</b>","Moreover, <b>Hunt and Lipo</b> are convinced that the settlers were not wholly<b> responsible </b>for the loss of the island’s trees. Archaeological finds of nuts from the extinct <b>Easter Island</b> palm show tiny grooves, made by the teeth of Polynesian rats. The rats arrived along with the settlers, and in <b>just a few</b> years, <b>Hunt and Lipo</b> calculate, they would have<b> overrun </b>the island. They would have prevented the reseeding of the slow-growing <b>palm trees</b> and thereby doomed Rapa Nui’s forest, even without the settlers’ campaign of deforestation. <b>No doubt</b> the rats ate birds’ eggs too. <b>Hunt and Lipo</b> <b>also see</b> <b>no evidence</b> that Rapanui civilisation collapsed when the palm forest did. They think its population grew rapidly and then remained more or less stable until the arrival of the Europeans, who introduced deadly diseases to which islanders <b>had no</b> immunity. Then in the <b>nineteenth century</b> slave traders decimated the population, which shrivelled to 111 people by 1877.","<b>G</b>","<b>Hunt and Lipo</b>’s vision, therefore, is one of an island populated by peaceful and<b> ingenious </b><b>moai builders</b> and careful stewards of the land, rather than by reckless destroyers ruining their own environment and society. ‘Rather than a case of abject failure, Rapu Nui is an unlikely story of success’, they claim. Whichever is the case, there are surely some valuable lessons which the world at large can learn from the story of Rapa Nui."]},{"name":"ARE/11-2-3","paragraph":["<h2>Neuroaesthetics</h2>","An emerging<b> discipline </b>called<b> neuroaesthetics </b>is seeking to bring scientific objectivity to the study of art, and <b>has already</b> given us a better <b>understanding of many</b> masterpieces. The blurred<b> imagery </b>of Impressionist paintings seems to<b> stimulate </b>the brain’s amygdala, for instance. Since the<b> amygdala </b>plays a crucial role in our feelings, that finding might explain why <b>many people</b> find these pieces so moving.","Could the <b>same approach</b> also<b> shed </b>light on abstract twentieth-century pieces, from Mondrian’s<b> geometrical </b>blocks of colour, to Pollock’s seemingly<b> haphazard </b>arrangements of splashed paint on canvas? Sceptics believe that people claim to like such works simply because they are famous. We <b>certainly do</b> have an<b> inclination </b>to follow the crowd. When asked to make simple<b> perceptual </b>decisions such as matching a shape to its rotated image, for example, <b>people often</b> choose a<b> definitively </b>wrong answer if they see others doing the same. It is easy to imagine that this<b> mentality </b>would have even more impact on a<b> fuzzy </b>concept <b>like art</b> appreciation, where there is no right or wrong answer.","Angelina Hawley-Dolan, of Boston College, Massachusetts, responded to this debate by asking volunteers to view pairs of paintings – either the creations of famous abstract artists or the doodles of infants,<b> chimps </b>and elephants. They then had to judge which they preferred. A third of the paintings were given no captions, <b>while many</b> were labelled incorrectly -volunteers might think they were viewing a chimp’s messy brushstrokes when they were actually seeing an acclaimed masterpiece. In each set of trials, volunteers generally<b> preferred </b>the work of<b> renowned </b>artists, even when they believed it was by an animal or a child. It seems that the viewer can sense the artist’s vision in paintings, even if they can’t explain why.","Robert Pepperell, an artist based at Cardiff University, creates<b> ambiguous </b>works that are neither entirely abstract nor clearly representational. In <b>one study</b>, Pepperell and his<b> collaborators </b><b>asked volunteers</b> to decide how ‘powerful’ they considered an artwork to be, and whether they saw anything familiar in the piece. The longer they took to answer these questions, the more highly they rated the piece under scrutiny, and the greater their<b> neural </b>activity. It would seem that the brain sees these images as puzzles, and the harder it is to decipher the meaning, the more rewarding is the moment of recognition.","And what about artists such as Mondrian, whose paintings consist<b> exclusively </b>of horizontal and vertical lines encasing blocks of colour? Mondrian’s works are deceptively simple, but eye-tracking studies confirm that they are meticulously composed, and that simply rotating a piece radically changes the way we view it. With the originals, volunteers’eyes tended to stay longer on <b>certain places</b> in the image, but with the altered versions, they would flit across a piece more rapidly. As a result, the volunteers considered the altered versions less pleasurable when they later rated the work.","In a similar study, Oshin Vartanian of Toronto University <b>asked volunteers</b> to compare original paintings with ones which he had altered by moving objects around within the frame. He found that <b>almost every</b>one<b> preferred </b>the original, whether it was a Van Gogh still life or an abstract by Miro. Vartanian <b>also found</b> that changing the<b> composition </b>of the paintings reduced activation in those <b>brain areas</b> linked with meaning and interpretation.","In another experiment, Alex Forsythe of the University of Liverpool analysed the visual intricacy of different pieces of art, and her <b>results suggest</b> that many artists use a key level of detail to please the brain. Too little and the work is boring, but <b>too much</b> results in a kind of ‘perceptual overload’, according to Forsythe. What’s more,<b> appealing </b>pieces both abstract and representational, <b>show signs</b> of ‘fractals’ – repeated motifs<b> recurring </b>in different scales, fractals are common throughout nature, for example in the shapes of mountain peaks or the branches of trees. It is possible that our visual system, which evolved in the great outdoors, finds it easier to process such patterns.","It is also<b> intriguing </b>that the brain appears to process movement when we see a handwritten letter, as if we are replaying the writer’s moment of creation. This has led some to <b>wonder whether</b> Pollock’s works feel so dynamic because the brain reconstructs the energetic actions the artist used as he painted. This may be down to our brain’s ‘mirror neurons’, which are known to mimic others’ actions. The<b> hypothesis </b>will need to be thoroughly tested, however. It might even be the case that we could use neuroaesthetic studies to understand the longevity of some pieces of artwork. While the fashions of the time might shape what is currently popular, works that are best adapted to our visual system may be the most likely to linger once the trends of previous generations have been forgotten.","It’s still early days for the field of<b> neuroaesthetics </b>– and these studies are probably only a taste of what is to come. It would, however, be foolish to reduce art appreciation to a set of scientific laws. We shouldn’t underestimate the importance of the style of a particular artist, their place in history and the artistic environment of their time. Abstract art offers both a challenge and the freedom to play with different interpretations. In <b><b>some way</b>s</b>, it’s not so different to science, where we are constantly looking for systems and decoding meaning so that we can view and appreciate the world in a new way."]},{"name":"ARE/11-3-1","paragraph":["<h2>THE STORY OF SILK</h2>","The history of the world’s most<b> luxurious </b>fabric, from ancient China  to the <b>present day</b>","Silk is a fine, smooth material produced from the<b> cocoons </b>– soft protective shells – that are made by mulberry<b> silkworms </b>(insect larvae). Legend has it that it was Lei Tzu, wife of the Yellow Emperor, ruler of China in about 3000 BC, who discovered silkworms. One account of the story goes that as she was taking a walk in her husband’s gardens, she discovered that<b> silkworms </b>were<b> responsible </b>for the destruction of several<b> mulberry </b>trees. She collected a number of<b> cocoons </b>and sat down to <b>have a rest</b>. It just so happened that while she was sipping some tea, one of the<b> cocoons </b>that she had collected landed in the hot tea and started to unravel into a fine thread. Lei Tzu found that she could wind this thread around her fingers. Subsequently, she persuaded her husband to allow her to rear<b> silkworms </b>on a grove of<b> mulberry </b>trees. She also<b> devised </b>a special reel to draw the<b> fibres </b>from the cocoon into a single thread so that they would be <b>strong enough</b> to be woven into fabric. While it is unknown <b>just how much</b> of this is true, it is certainly known that silk<b> cultivation </b>has existed in China for several millennia.","Originally,<b> silkworm </b>farming was solely restricted to women, and it was they who were<b> responsible </b>for the growing, harvesting and weaving. Silk quickly grew into a symbol of status, and originally, only royalty were<b> entitled </b>to have clothes made of silk. The rules were gradually relaxed over the years until finally during the Qing Dynasty (1644—1911 AD), even peasants, the lowest caste, were also<b> entitled </b>to wear silk. Sometime during the Han Dynasty (206 BC-220 AD), silk was so prized that it was <b><b>also use</b>d</b> as a unit of currency. <b>Government officials</b> were paid their salary in silk, and farmers paid their taxes in grain and silk. Silk was <b><b>also use</b>d</b> as<b> diplomatic </b>gifts by the emperor. Fishing lines, bowstrings, musical instruments and paper were all made using silk. The earliest<b> indication </b>of silk paper being used was discovered in the tomb of a noble who is<b> estimated </b>to <b>have died</b> around 168 AD.","Demand for this<b> exotic </b>fabric eventually created the lucrative trade route <b>now known</b> as the Silk Road, taking silk westward and bringing gold, silver and<b> wool </b>to the East. It was named the Silk Road after its most<b> precious </b>commodity, which was considered to be worth more than gold. The Silk Road stretched over 6,000 kilometres from Eastern China to the Mediterranean Sea, following the Great Wall of China, climbing the Pamir mountain range, crossing modern-day Afghanistan and going on to the <b>Middle East</b>, with a major trading market in Damascus. From there, the merchandise was shipped across the Mediterranean Sea. Few merchants travelled the entire route; goods were handled mostly by a series of middlemen.","With the<b> mulberry </b>silkworm being native to China, the country was the world’s sole producer of silk for many <b>hundreds of years</b>. The secret of silk-making eventually reached the <b>rest of the world</b> via the Byzantine Empire, which ruled over the Mediterranean region of southern Europe, North Africa and the <b>Middle East</b> during the period 330—1453 AD. According to another legend, monks working for the Byzantine<b> emperor </b>Justinian smuggle<b> silkworm </b>eggs to Constantinople (Istanbul in modern-day Turkey) in 550 AD, concealed inside<b> hollow </b>bamboo walking canes. The Byzantines were as<b> secretive </b>as the Chinese, however, and for <b>many centuries</b> the weaving and trading of silk fabric was a strict imperial monopoly. Then in the seventh century, the Arabs<b> conquered </b>Persia, capturing their magnificent silks in the process.","<b>Silk production</b> thus spread through Africa, Sicily and Spain as the Arabs swept, through these lands. Andalusia in southern Spain was Europe’s main silk-producing centre in the tenth century. By the thirteenth century, however, Italy <b>had become</b> Europe’s leader in <b>silk production</b> and export. Venetian merchants traded extensively in silk and encouraged silk growers to settle in Italy. Even now, silk processed in the province of Como in northern Italy enjoys an esteemed reputation.","The <b>nineteenth century</b> and<b> industrialisation </b>saw the downfall of the European silk industry. Cheaper Japanese silk, trade in which was greatly<b> facilitated </b>by the opening of the Suez Canal, was one of the <b>many factors</b> driving the trend. Then in the <b>twentieth century</b>, new manmade fibres, such as nylon, started to be used in what had traditionally been silk products, such as stockings and parachutes. The two <b>world war</b>s, which interrupted the supply of <b>raw material</b> from Japan, also<b> stifled </b>the European silk industry. After the <b>Second World</b> War, Japan’s <b>silk production</b> was restored, with improved production and quality of raw silk. Japan was to remain the world’s biggest producer of raw silk, and practically the only major exporter of raw silk, until the 1970s. However, in more recent decades, China has gradually recaptured its position as the world’s biggest producer and exporter of raw silk and silk yarn. Today, around 125,000 metric tons of silk are produced in the world, and almost two thirds of that production <b>takes place</b> in China."]},{"name":"ARE/11-3-2","paragraph":["<h2>Great Migrations</h2>","Animal migration, however it is defined, is far more than just the <b>movement of animals</b>. It can loosely be described as travel that <b>takes place</b> at regular intervals – often in an annual cycle – that may involve <b>many members</b> of a species, and is rewarded only after a long journey. It suggests inherited instinct. The biologist Hugh Dingle <b>has identified</b> five characteristics that apply, in varying degrees and combinations, to all migrations. They are prolonged movements that carry animals outside familiar habitats; they tend to be linear, not zigzaggy; they involve special behaviours concerning preparation (such as overfeeding) and arrival; they demand special allocations of energy. And one more: migrating animals maintain an intense<b> attentiveness </b>to the greater mission, which keeps them undistracted by temptations and undeterred by challenges that would turn <b>other animals</b> aside.","An arctic tern, on its 20,000 km flight from the extreme south of <b>South America</b> to the Arctic circle, will <b>take no</b> notice of a nice smelly herring offered from a bird-watcher’s boat along the way. While local gulls will dive voraciously for such handouts, the tern flies on. Why? The arctic tern resists distraction because it is driven at that moment by an instinctive sense of something we humans find admirable: larger purpose. In other words, it is determined to reach its destination. The bird senses that it can eat, rest and mate later. <b>Right now</b> it is totally focused on the journey; its undivided intent is arrival.","Reaching some gravelly coastline in the Arctic, upon which other arctic terns have converged, will serve its larger purpose as shaped by evolution: finding a place, a time, and a set of circumstances in which it can successfully<b> hatch </b>and rear offspring.","But migration is a complex issue, and biologists define it differently, depending in part on what sorts of animals they study. Joe! Berger, of the University of Montana, who works on the American<b> pronghorn </b>and other large<b> terrestrial </b>mammals,<b> prefers </b>what he calls a simple, practical definition suited to his beasts: ‘movements from a<b> seasonal </b>home area away to another home area and back again’. Generally, the reason for such<b> seasonal </b>back-and-forth movement is to seek resources that aren’t available within a single area year-round.","But daily vertical movements by zooplankton in the ocean – upward by night to seek food, downward by day to escape predators – can also be considered migration. So can the movement of<b> aphids </b>when, having<b> depleted </b>the young leaves on one food plant, their<b> offspring </b>then fly onward to a different<b> host </b>plant, with <b>no one</b><b> aphid </b>ever returning to where it started.","Dingle is an evolutionary biologist who studies insects. His definition is more<b> intricate </b>than Berger’s, citing those five features that distinguish migration from <b>other forms</b> of movement. They allow for the fact that, for example,<b> aphids </b>will become sensitive to blue light (from the sky) when it’s time for takeoff on their big journey, and sensitive to yellow light (reflected from tender young leaves) when it’s appropriate to land. Birds will fatten themselves with heavy feeding in advance of a long<b> migrational </b>flight. The value of his definition, Dingle argues, is that it focuses attention on what the<b> phenomenon </b>of<b> wildebeest </b>migration shares with the<b> phenomenon </b>of the aphids, and therefore helps guide researchers towards understanding how evolution <b>has produced</b> them all.","Human behaviour, however, is having a<b> detrimental </b>impact on animal migration. The pronghorn, which<b> resembles </b>an antelope, though they are unrelated, is the fastest land mammal of the <b>New World</b>. One population, which spends the summer in the<b> mountainous </b>Grand Teton <b>National Park</b> of the western USA, follows a narrow route from its summer range in the mountains, across a river, and down onto the plains. Here they wait out the frozen months, feeding mainly on sagebrush blown clear of snow. These<b> pronghorn </b>are notable for the invariance of their <b>migration route</b> and the<b> severity </b>of its construction at three bottlenecks. If they can’t pass through each of the three during their spring migration, they can’t reach their<b> bounty </b>of summer grazing; if they can’t pass through again in autumn, escaping south onto those<b> windblown </b>plains, they are likely to die trying to overwinter in the deep snow. Pronghorn, dependent on distance vision and speed to keep safe from predators, traverse high, open shoulders of land, where they can see and run. At one of the bottlenecks, forested hills rise to form a V, leaving a corridor of open ground only about 150 <b>metres wide</b>, filled with private homes. Increasing development is leading toward a crisis for the pronghorn,<b> threatening </b>to choke off their passageway.","Conservation scientists, along with some biologists and <b>land managers</b> within the USA’s <b>National Park</b> Service and other agencies, are <b>now working</b> to preserve<b> migrational </b>behaviours, not just<b> species </b>and habitats. A National Forest has recognised the path of the pronghorn, much of which passes across its land, as a protected migration corridor. But neither the Forest Service nor the Park Service can control what happens on private land at a bottleneck. And with certain other migrating species, the challenge is complicated further – by vastly greater distances traversed, more jurisdictions, more borders, more dangers along the way. We will require wisdom and resoluteness to ensure that migrating<b> species </b>can continue their journeying a while longer."]},{"name":"ARE/11-3-3","paragraph":["Preface to How the other half thinks: Adventures in<b> mathematical </b>reasoning","<b>A</b>","Occasionally, in some difficult musical compositions, there are beautiful, but easy parts – parts so simple a beginner could play them. So it is with<b> mathematics </b>as well. T<b>here are some</b> discoveries in advanced<b> mathematics </b>that do not depend on<b> specialized </b>knowledge, not even on algebra, geometry, or trigonometry. Instead, they may involve, at most, a little arithmetic, such as ‘the sum of two odd numbers is even’, and common sense. Each of the eight chapters in this book illustrates this phenomenon. Anyone can understand every step in the reasoning. The thinking in each chapter uses at most only elementary arithmetic, and sometimes not even that. Thus all readers will <b>have the chance</b> to participate in a<b> mathematical </b>experience, to appreciate the beauty of mathematics, and to become familiar with its logical, yet intuitive, style of thinking.","<b>B</b>","One of my purposes in writing this book is to give readers who haven’t had the <b>opportunity to see</b> and enjoy real<b> mathematics </b>the chance to appreciate the<b> mathematical </b>way of thinking. I want to reveal not only some of the fascinating discoveries, but, more importantly, the reasoning behind them. In that respect, this book differs from most books on<b> mathematics </b>written for the general public. Some present the lives of colorful mathematicians. Others describe important applications of mathematics. Yet others go into<b> mathematical </b>procedures, but assume that the reader is adept in using algebra.","<b>C</b>","<b>I </b> hope this book will help bridge that notorious gap that separates the two cultures: the<b> humanities </b>and the sciences, or should I say the right brain (intuitive) and the left brain (analytical, numerical). As the chapters will illustrate,<b> mathematics </b>is not restricted to the analytical and numerical; intuition plays a significant role. The alleged gap can be narrowed or completely overcome by anyone, in <b>part because</b> each of us is far from using the full capacity of either side of the brain. To illustrate our human potential, I cite a structural engineer who is an artist, an electrical engineer who is an opera singer, an opera singer who published<b> mathematical </b>research, and a mathematician who publishes short stories.","<b>D</b>","<b>Other scientists</b> have written books to explain their fields to non-scientists, but have necessarily had to omit the mathematics, although it provides the foundation of their theories. The reader must remain a tantalized<b> spectator </b>rather than an involved participant, since the appropriate language for describing the details in much of science is mathematics, whether the subject is expanding universe, subatomic particles, or chromosomes. Though the broad.outline of a scientific theory can be sketched intuitively, when a part of the physical universe is finally understood, its description often <b>looks like</b> a page in a<b> mathematics </b>text.","<b>E</b>","Still, the non-mathematical reader can go far in understanding<b> mathematical </b>reasoning. This book presents the details that illustrate the<b> mathematical </b>style of thinking, which involves sustained, step-by-step analysis, experiments, and insights. You will turn these pages much more slowly than when reading a novel or a newspaper. It may help to have a pencil and paper ready to check claims and carry out experiments.","<b>F</b>","As I wrote, I kept in mind <b>two types</b> of readers: those who enjoyed<b> mathematics </b>until they were turned off by an unpleasant episode, usually around fifth grade, and<b> mathematics </b>aficionados, who will find much that is new throughout the book. This book also serves readers who simply want to sharpen their analytical skills. Many careers, such as law and medicine, require extended, precise analysis. Each chapter offers practice in following a<b> sustained </b>and closely argued line of thought. That<b> mathematics </b>can develop this skill is shown by these two testimonials:","<b>G</b>","<b>A </b><b> physician </b>wrote, The<b> discipline </b>of analytical thought processes [in mathematics] prepared me <b>extremely well</b> for <b>medical school</b>.

Because <b>identical twins</b> come from a single<b> fertilized </b>egg that splits into two, they share virtually the same genetic code. Any differences between them -one twin having younger looking skin, for example – must be due to environmental factors such as <b>less time</b> spent in the sun.","Alternatively, by comparing the experiences of <b>identical twins</b> with those of<b> fraternal </b>twins, who come from separate eggs and share on average half their DNA, researchers can quantify the extent to which our genes affect our lives. If <b>identical twins</b> are more similar to <b>each other</b> with respect to an ailment than<b> fraternal </b>twins are, then<b> vulnerability </b>to the disease must be rooted at least in part in heredity.","These two lines of research – studying the differences between <b>identical twins</b> to pinpoint the influence of environment, and comparing <b>identical twins</b> with<b> fraternal </b>ones to measure the role of inheritance – have been crucial to understanding the interplay of <b>nature and nurture</b> in determining our personalities, behavior, and<b> vulnerability </b>to disease.","The idea of using twins to measure the influence of<b> heredity </b><b>dates back</b> to 1875, when the English scientist Francis Galton first suggested the approach (and coined the phrase ‘<b>nature and nurture</b>’). But <b>twin studies</b> took a surprising twist in the 1980s, with the arrival of studies into <b>identical twins</b> who had been<b> separated </b>at birth and reunited as adults. Over <b>two decades</b> 137 sets of twins eventually visited Thomas Bouchard’s lab in what beca<b>me know</b>n as the Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart.<b> Numerous </b>tests were carried out on the twins, and they were each asked more than 15,000 questions.","Bouchard and his colleagues used this mountain of data to identify how far twins were affected by their genetic makeup. The key to their approach was a<b> statistical </b>concept called heritability. in broad terms, the<b> heritability </b>of a trait measures the extent to which differences among members of a population can be explained by differences in their genetics. And wherever Bouchard and <b>other scientists</b> looked, it seemed, they found the invisible hand of genetic influence helping to shape our lives.","Lately, however, <b>twin <b>studies have</b></b> helped lead scientists to a<b> radical </b>new conclusion: that <b>nature and nurture</b> are not the only elemental forces at work. According to a recent field called epigenetics, there is a third factor also in play, one that in <b>some cases</b> serves as a bridge between the environment and our genes, and in others operates on its own to shape who we are.","<b>Epigenetic processes</b> are chemical reactions tied to neither nature nor nurture but representing what <b>researchers have</b> called a ‘third component’. These reactions influence how our genetic code is expressed: how each gene is<b> strengthened </b>or weakened, even turned on or off, to build our bones, brains and <b>all the other</b> parts of our bodies.","If you think of our DNA as an<b> immense </b>piano keyboard and our genes as the keys – each key symbolizing a segment of DNA<b> responsible </b>for a particular note, or trait, and all the keys combining to make us who we are – then <b>epigenetic processes</b> determine when and how each key can be struck, changing the tune being played.","<b>One way</b> the study of<b> epigenetics </b>is revolutionizing our understanding of biology is by<b> revealing </b>a mechanism by which the environment directly impacts on genes. Studies of animals, for example, <b>have shown</b> that when a rat experiences stress during pregnancy, it can cause<b> epigenetic </b>changes in a fetus that lead to behavioral problems as the rodent grows up. Other <b>epigenetic processes</b> appear to occur randomly, <b>while others</b> are normal, such as those that guide embryonic cells as they become heart, brain, or liver cells, for example.","Geneticist Danielle<b> Reed </b>has worked with many twins over the years and thought deeply about what <b>twin <b>studies have</b></b> taught us. ‘It’s <b>very clear</b> when you look at twins that much of what they share is hardwired,’ she says. ‘Many things about them are absolutely the same and unalterable. But it’s also clear, when you <b>get to know</b> them, that <b>other things</b> about them are different.<b> Epigenetics </b>is the origin of a lot of those differences, in my view.’","Reed credits Thomas Bouchard’s work for today’s surge in <b>twin studies</b>. ‘He was the trailblazer,’ she says. ‘We forget that 50 <b>years ago</b> <b>things like</b> <b>heart disease</b> were thought to be caused entirely by lifestyle.<b> Schizophrenia </b>was thought to be due to poor mothering. <b>Twin <b>studies have</b></b> allowed us to be more reflective about what people are <b>actually born</b> with and what’s caused by experience.’","Having said that,<b> Reed </b>adds, the latest work in<b> epigenetics </b>promises to take our understanding <b>even further</b>. ‘What I like to say is that nature writes <b>some things</b> in pencil and <b>some things</b> in pen,’ she says. ‘Things written in pen you can’t change. That’s DNA. But things written in pencil you can. That’s epigenetics.

A meaningful sound track is often as complicated as the image on the screen, and is ultimately just as much the<b> responsibility </b>of the director. The entire sound track consists of three essential ingredients: the human voice, sound effects and music. These three tracks must be mixed and balanced so as to produce the necessary emphases which in turn create desired effects. Topics which essentially refer to the three previously mentioned tracks are discussed below. They include dialogue, synchronous and asynchronous sound effects, and music.","Let us start with dialogue. As is the case with stage drama, dialogue serves to tell the story and expresses feelings and motivations of characters as well. Often with film characterization the audience perceives <b>little or no</b> difference between the character and the actor. Thus, for example, the actor Humphrey Bogart is the character Sam Spade; film personality and life personality seem to merge. Perhaps this is because the very texture of a performer’s voice supplies an element of character.","When voice textures fit the performer’s physiognomy and gestures, a whole and very realistic persona emerges. The viewer sees not an actor working at his craft, but another human being struggling with life. It is interesting to note that how dialogue is used and the very amount of dialogue used varies widely among films. For example, in the highly successful science-fiction film 2001, little dialogue was evident, and most of it was<b> banal </b>and of little<b> intrinsic </b>interest. In this way, the film-maker was able to portray what Thomas Sobochack and Vivian Sobochack call, in An Introduction to Film, the ‘inadequacy of human responses when compared with the magnificent technology created by man and the visual beauties of the universe’.","The comedy Bringing Up Baby, on the other hand, presents practically non-stop dialogue delivered at breakneck speed. This use of dialogue underscores not only the dizzy quality of the character played by Katherine Hepburn, but also the absurdity of the film itself and thus its humor. The audience is bounced from<b> gag </b>to<b> gag </b>and conversation to conversation; there is <b>no time</b> for audience reflection. The audience is caught up in a whirlwind of activity in simply managing to follow the plot. This film presents pure escapism – largely due to its frenetic dialogue.","Synchronous sound effects are those sounds which are synchronized or matched with what is viewed. For example, if the film<b> portrays </b>a character playing the piano, the sounds of the piano are projected. Synchronous sounds contribute to the<b> realism </b>of film and <b>also help</b> to create a particular atmosphere. For example, the ‘click’ of a door being opened may simply serve to convince the audience that the image portrayed is real, and the audience may only<b> subconsciously </b>note the expected sound. However, if the ‘click’ of an opening door is part of an ominous action such as a burglary, the sound mixer may call attention to the ‘click’ with an increase in volume; this helps to engage the audience in a moment of suspense.","Asynchronous sound effects, on the other hand, are not matched with a visible source of the sound on screen. Such sounds are included so as to provide an appropriate emotional nuance, and they may also add to the<b> realism </b>of the film. For example, a film-maker might opt to include the background sound of an ambulance’s<b> siren </b>while the foreground sound and image<b> portrays </b>an arguing couple. The asynchronous ambulance<b> siren </b>underscores the psychic injury incurred in the argument; at the <b>same time</b>, the noise of the<b> siren </b>adds to the<b> realism </b>of the film by acknowledging the film’s city setting.","We are probably <b>all familiar</b> with <b>background music</b> in films, which <b>has become</b> so<b> ubiquitous </b>as to be noticeable in its absence. We are aware that it is used to add emotion and rhythm. Usually not meant to be noticeable, it often provides a tone or an emotional attitude toward the story and /or the characters depicted. In addition, <b>background music</b> often foreshadows a change in mood. For example, dissonant music may be used in film to indicate an approaching (but not yet visible)<b> menace </b>or disaster.","<b>Background music</b> may aid viewer understanding by linking scenes. For example, a particular musical theme associated with an individual character or situation may be repeated at various points in a film in order to remind the audience of salient<b> motifs </b>or ideas.","<b>Film sound</b> comprises conventions and innovations. We <b>have come</b> to expect an acceleration of <b>music during</b> car chases and creaky doors in horror films. Yet, it is important to note as well that sound is often brilliantly conceived. The effects of sound are often largely subtle and often are noted by only our subconscious minds. We need to<b> foster </b>an awareness of <b>film sound</b> as well as film space so as to truly appreciate an <b>art form</b> that sprang to life during the <b>twentieth century</b> – the modern film."]},{"name":"ARE/11-4-3","paragraph":["<h2>This Marvellous Invention</h2>","<b>A.</b>  Of all mankinds manifold creations, language must take pride of place. Other inventions -the wheel, agriculture, sliced bread – may have transformed our material existence, but the<b> advent </b>of language is what made us human. Compared to language, <b>all other</b> inventions<b> pale </b>in significance, since everything we <b>have ever</b> achieved depends on language and originates from it. Without language, we could never have embarked on our ascent to unparalleled power over all <b>other animals</b>, and even over nature itself.","<b>B.</b>  But language is foremost not <b>just because</b> it <b>came first</b>. In its own right it is a tool of extraordinary sophistication, yet based on an idea of<b> ingenious </b>simplicity: ‘this marvellous invention of composing out of twenty-five or thirty sounds that<b> infinite </b>variety of expressions which,<b> whilst </b>having in themselves no likeness to what is in our mind, allow us to disclose to others its whole secret, and to make known to those who cannot<b> penetrate </b>it all that we imagine, and all the various stirrings of our soul’ This was how, in 1660, the <b>renowned French</b> grammarians of the Port-Royal abbey near Versailles<b> distilled </b>the essence of language, and <b>no one</b> since has celebrated more eloquently the<b> magnitude </b>of its achievement. Even so, there is <b>just one</b><b> flaw </b>in all these hymns of praise, for the homage to languages unique accomplishment<b> conceals </b>a simple yet critical incongruity. Language is mankind s greatest invention – except, of course, that it was never invented. This apparent<b> paradox </b>is at the core of our fascination with language, and it holds many of its secrets.","<b>C.</b>  Language often seems so skillfully drafted that one can hardly imagine it as <b>anything other</b> than the perfected handiwork of a master craftsman. How else could this instrument make so much out of barely three dozen measly morsels of sound? In themselves, these configurations of mouth p, f, b, v, t, d, k, g, sh, a, e and so on – amount to nothing more than a few<b> haphazard </b>spits and splutters, random noises with no meaning, no ability to express, no power to explain. But run them through the<b> cogs </b>and wheels of the language machine, let it arrange them in <b>some <b>very special</b></b> orders, and there is nothing that these meaningless streams of air cannot do: from signing the interminable boredom of existence to<b> unravelling </b>the fundamental order of the universe.","<b>D.</b>  the most extraordinary thing about language, however, is that one doesn’t have to be a genius to set its wheels in motion. The language machine allows <b>just about everybody</b> from pre-modern foragers in the subtropical savannah, to post-modern<b> philosophers </b>in the<b> suburban </b>sprawl – to tie these meaningless sounds together into an<b> infinite </b>variety of subtle senses, and all apparently without the slightest exertion. Yet it is precisely this deceptive ease which makes language a victim of its own success, since in <b>everyday life</b> its<b> triumphs </b>are usually <b>taken for granted</b>. The wheels of language run so smoothly that one rarely bothers to stop and think about all the resourcefulness and expertise that must <b>have gone</b> into making it tick. Language<b> conceals </b>art.","<b>E.</b>  Often, it is only the estrangement of foreign tongues, with their many<b> exotic </b>and<b> outlandish </b>features, that brings home the wonder of languages design. One of the showiest stunts that some languages can pull off is an ability to <b>build up</b> words of breath-breaking length, and thus express in one word what English takes a whole sentence to say. The Turkish word çehirliliçtiremediklerimizdensiniz, to take <b>one example</b>, means nothing less than ‘you are one of those whom we can’t turn into a town-dweller’. (In case you were wondering, this monstrosity really is one word, not merely <b>many different</b> words squashed together – most of its components cannot even stand up on their own.)","<b>F.</b>  And if that <b>sounds like</b> some one-off freak, then consider Sumerian, the language spoken on the banks of the Euphrates some 5,000 <b>years ago</b> by the people who invented writing and thus enabled the documentation of history. A Sumerian word like munintuma’a (‘when he <b>had made</b> it suitable for her’) might seem rather trim compared to the Turkish colossus above. What is so<b> impressive </b>about it, however, is not its lengthiness but rather the reverse – the thrifty compactness of its construction. The word is <b>made up</b> of different slots, each<b> corresponding </b>to a particular portion of meaning. This<b> sleek </b>design allows single sounds to convey useful information, and in fact, even the absence of a sound has been enlisted to express something specific. If you were to ask which bit in the Sumerian word corresponds to the pronoun ‘it’ in the English translation ‘when he <b>had made</b> it suitable for her’, then the answer would have to be nothing. Mind you, a very particular kind of nothing: the nothing that stands in the empty<b> slot </b>in the middle. The technology is so fine-tuned then that even a non-sound, when carefully placed in a particular position, has been invested with a specific function.

From the planting of a<b> cork </b>sapling to the first harvest takes 25 years, and a gap of approximately a decade must separate harvests from an individual tree. And for top-quality cork, it’s necessary to wait a further 15 or 20 years. You even <b>have to wait</b> for the right kind of summer’s day to harvest cork. If the bark is<b> stripped </b>on a day when it’s too cold – or when the air is damp – the tree will be damaged.","Cork harvesting is a <b>very special</b>ised profession. No mechanical means of<b> stripping </b>cork bark has been invented, so the job is done by teams of highly skilled workers. First, they make vertical cuts down the bark using small sharp axes, then lever it away in pieces as large as they can manage. The most skilful cork- strippers prise away a semi-circular<b> husk </b>that runs the length of the trunk from just above <b>ground level</b> to the first branches. It is then<b> dried </b>on the ground for about <b>four months</b>, before being taken to factories, where it is boiled to kill any insects that might remain in the cork. Over 60% of<b> cork </b>then goes on to be made into traditional bottle stoppers, with most of the remainder being <b>used in the construction</b> trade, Corkboard and cork<b> tiles </b>are ideal for<b> thermal </b>and acoustic insulation, while granules of<b> cork </b>are used in the manufacture of concrete.","<b>Recent years</b> <b>have seen</b> the end of the virtual<b> monopoly </b>of<b> cork </b>as the material for bottle stoppers, due to concerns about the effect it may have on the contents of the bottle. This is caused by a chemical<b> compound </b>called 2,4,6-trichloroanisole (TCA), which forms through the interaction of plant phenols, chlorine and mould. The tiniest<b> concentrations </b>– as little as <b>three or four</b> parts to a trillion – can<b> spoil </b>the taste of the product contained in the bottle. The result has been a gradual yet steady move first towards plastic stoppers and, more recently, to<b> aluminium </b>screw caps. These substitutes are <b>cheaper to manufacture</b> and, in the case of<b> screw </b>caps, more convenient for the user.","The classic<b> cork </b>stopper does <b>have several</b> advantages, however. Firstly, its traditional image is more in keeping with that of the type of <b>high quality</b> goods with which it <b>has long</b> been associated. Secondly – and <b>very important</b>ly –<b> cork </b>is a<b> sustainable </b>product that can be<b> recycled </b>without difficulty. Moreover,<b> cork </b>forests are a<b> resource </b>which supports local biodiversity, and prevents desertification in the regions where they are planted. So, given the current concerns about environmental issues, the future of this ancient material <b>once again</b> looks promising."]},{"name":"ARE/12-1-2","paragraph":["<h2>COLLECTING AS A HOBBY</h2>","Collecting must be <b>one of the most</b> varied of human activities, and it’s one that many of us<b> psychologists </b>find fascinating.","Many forms of collecting have been dignified with a technical name: an archtophilist collects teddy bears, a philatelist collects<b> postage </b>stamps, and a deltiologist collects postcards. Amassing hundreds or even thousands of postcards, chocolate wrappers or whatever, takes time, energy and money that could surely to much more productive use. And yet there are millions of collectors a<b>round the world</b>. Why <b>do they do</b> it?","There are the people who collect because they <b>want to make</b> money – this could be called an instrumental reason for collecting; that is, collecting as a means to an end. They’ll look for, say,<b> antiques </b>that they can buy cheaply and expect to be able to sell at a profit. But there may well be a<b> psychological </b>element, too – buying cheap and selling dear can give the collector a sense of triumph. And as selling online is so easy, more and more people are joining in.","Many collectors collect to develop their<b> social </b>life, attending meetings of a group of collectors and <b>exchanging information</b> on items. This is a variant on joining a bridge club or a gym, and<b> similarly </b>brings them into contact with like-minded people. Another motive for collecting is the desire to find <b>something special</b>, or a <b>particular example</b> of the collected item, such as a rare early recording by a particular singer.","Some may spend their whole lives in a hunt for this. Psychologically, this can give a purpose to a life that otherwise feels aimless. There is a danger, though, that if the individual is ever lucky enough to find what they’re looking for, rather than celebrating their success, they may feel empty, now that the goal that drove them on <b>has gone</b>.","If you think about collecting<b> postage </b>stamps another potential reason for it – Or, perhaps, a result of collecting is its educational value. Stamp collecting opens a window to <b>other countries</b>, and to the plants, animals, or famous people shown on their stamps.","Similarly, in the 19th century, many collectors amassed fossils, animals and plants from around the globe, and their collections provided a vast <b>amount of information</b> about the <b>natural world</b>. Without those collections, our understanding would be greatly inferior to what it is.","In the past – and nowadays, too, though to a lesser extent – a popular form of collecting, particularly among boys and men, was trainspotting. This might involve trying to see every locomotive of a <b>particular type</b>, using published data that identifies <b>each one</b>, and ticking off each engine as it is seen. Trainspotters exchange information, these days often by mobile phone, so they can work out where to go to, to see a particular engine. As a by-product, many practitioners of the hobby become very<b> knowledgeable </b>about railway operations, or the technical specifications of different engine types.","Similarly, people who collect dolls may <b>go beyond</b> simply enlarging their collection, and develop an interest in the way that dolls are made, or the materials that are used. These <b>have <b>changed over the centuries</b></b> from the wood that was standard in 16th century Europe, through the wax and<b> porcelain </b>of later centuries, to the plastics of today’s dolls. Or collectors might be inspired to study how dolls reflect notions of what children like, or ought to like.","Not all collectors are interested in learning from their hobby, though, so what we might call a<b> psychological </b>reason for collecting is the need for a sense of control, perhaps as a way of dealing with insecurity. Stamp collectors, for instance, arrange their stamps in albums, <b>usually very</b> neatly, organising their collection according to certain commonplace principles-perhaps by country in alphabetical order, or grouping stamps by what they depict -people, birds, maps, and so on.","<b>One reason</b>,<b> conscious </b>or not, for what someone chooses to collect is to show the collector’s individualism. Someone who decides to collect something as unexpected as dog collars, for instance, may be conveying their belief that they must be interesting themselves. And believe it or not, there is at <b>least one</b> dog collar museum in existence, and it grew out of a personal collection.","Of course, all hobbies give pleasure, but the common factor in collecting is usually passion: pleasure is putting it far too mildly. More than <b>most other</b> hobbies, collecting can be totally engrossing, and can give a strong sense of personal fulfilment. To non-collectors, it may appear an eccentric, if harmless, way of <b>spending time</b>, but potentially, collecting <b>has a lot</b> going for it."]},{"name":"ARE/12-1-3","paragraph":["<h2>What’s the purpose of gaining knowledge?</h2>","<b>A</b>","‘I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any subject’ That was the founder’s motto for Cornell University, and it seems an apt characterization of the different university, also in the USA, where I currently teach philosophy. A student can prepare for a career in<b> resort </b>management, engineering, interior design, accounting, music, <b>law enforcement</b>, you name it. But what would the founders of these two institutions <b>have thought</b> of a course called<b> Arson </b>for Profit’? I kid you not: we have it on the books. Any undergraduates who <b>have met</b> the academic requirements can <b>sign up</b> for the course in our program in ‘fire science’.","<b>B</b>","Naturally, the course is intended for prospective<b> arson </b>investigators, who can learn all the tricks of the trade for detecting whether a fire was deliberately set, discovering who did it, and establishing a chain of evidence for effective prosecution in a court of law. But wouldn’t this also be the perfect course for prospective arsonists to <b>sign up</b> for? My point is not to criticize academic programs in fire science: they are highly welcome as part of the increasing professionalization of this and <b>m<b>any other</b></b> occupations. However, it’s not unknown for a firefighter to torch a building. This example suggests how dishonest and illegal behavior, with the help of higher education, can<b> creep </b>into every aspect of public and business life.","<b>C</b>","<b>I </b> realized this anew when I was invited to speak before a class in marketing, which is another of our degree programs. The regular instructor is a colleague who appreciates the kind of ethical<b> perspective </b>I can bring as a philosopher. There are endless ways I could have approached this assignment, but I took my<b> cue </b>from the title of the course: ‘Principles of Marketing’. It <b>made me</b> think to ask the students, ‘Is marketing principled?’ After all, a <b>subject matter</b> can have<b> principles </b>in the sense of being codified, having rules, as with football or chess, without being<b> principled </b>in the sense of being ethical. Many of the students immediately assumed that the answer to my question about marketing<b> principles </b>was obvious: no. <b>Just look</b> at the ways in which everything under the sun has been marketed; obviously, it need not be done in a<b> principled </b>(=ethical) fashion.","<b>D</b>","Is that obvious? I made the suggestion, which may sound downright crazy in light of the evidence, that perhaps marketing is by definition principled. My<b> inspiration </b>for this judgement is the<b> philosopher </b>Immanuel Kant, who argued that any body of knowledge consists of an end (or purpose) and a means.","<b>E</b>","Let us apply both the terms ‘means’ and ‘end’ to marketing. The students have signed up for a course in order to learn how to market effectively. But to what end? There seem to be two main attitudes toward that question. One is that the answer is obvious: the purpose of marketing is to sell things and to make money. The other attitude is that the purpose of marketing is irrelevant: <b>Each person</b> comes to the program and course with his or her own plans, and these need not even concern the acquisition of marketing expertise as such. My proposal, which I believe would also be Kant’s, is that neither of these attitudes captures the significance of the end to the means for marketing. A field of knowledge or a professional<b> endeavor </b>is defined by both the means and the end; hence both deserve scrutiny. Students need to study both how to achieve X, and also what X is.","<b>F</b>","It is at this point that ‘Arson for Profit’ becomes<b> supremely </b>relevant. That course is<b> presumably </b>all about means: how to detect and prosecute criminal activity. It is therefore assumed that the end is good in an<b> ethical </b>sense. When I ask fire science students to<b> articulate </b>the end, or purpose, of their field, they eventually generalize to <b>something like</b>, ‘The safety and welfare of society,’ which seems right. As we <b>have seen</b>, someone could use the very sa<b>me know</b>ledge of means to achieve a <b>much less</b> noble end, such as personal profit via destructive, dangerous, reckless activity. But we would not call that firefighting. We <b>have a separate</b> word for it: arson. Similarly, if you employed the ‘principles of marketing’ in an unprincipled way, you would not be doing marketing. We <b>have another</b> term for it: fraud. Kant gives the example of a doctor and a poisoner, who use the identical knowledge to achieve their divergent ends. We would say that one is practicing medicine, the other, murder."]},{"name":"ARE/12-2-1","paragraph":["The risks agriculture faces in <b>developing countries</b>","Synthesis of an online debate","<b>A</b>","<b>Two things</b> distinguish <b>food production</b> from <b>all other</b> productive activities: first, <b>every single</b> person needs food <b>each day</b> and has a right to it; and second, it is hugely dependent on nature. These two unique aspects, one political, the other natural, make <b>food production</b> highly<b> vulnerable </b>and different from <b>any other</b> business. At the <b>same time</b>, cultural values are highly<b> entrenched </b>in food and agricultural systems worldwide.","<b>B</b>","Farmers everywhere face major risks; including extreme weather, long-term <b>climate change</b>, and <b>price volatility</b> in input and product markets. However, <b>smallholder farmers</b> in <b>developing countries</b> must in addition deal with adverse environments, both natural, in terms of soil quality, rainfall, etc. and human, in terms of infrastructure, financial systems, markets, knowledge and technology. Counter-intuitively, hunger is<b> prevalent </b>among many <b>smallholder farmers</b> in the <b>developing world</b>.","<b>C</b>","Participants in the online debate argued that our biggest challenge is to address the underlying causes of the agricultural system’s<b> inability </b>to ensure sufficient food for all, and they identified as drivers of this problem our dependency on<b> fossil </b>fuels and unsupportive government policies.","<b>D</b>","On the question of mitigating the risks farmers face, most essayists called for greater state intervention. In his essay, Kanayo F. Nwanze, President of the International Fund for Agricultural Development, argued that governments can significantly reduce risks for farmers by providing basic services like roads to get produce more efficiently to markets, or water and food storage<b> facilities </b>to reduce losses. Sophia Murphy, senior advisor to the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, suggested that the<b> procurement </b>and holding of stocks by governments can <b>also help</b><b> mitigate </b>wild swings in food prices by alleviating uncertainties about market supply.","<b>E</b>","Shenggen Fan, Director General of the International Food Policy Research Institute, held up<b> social </b>safety nets and public welfare programmes in Ethiopia, Brazil and Mexico as valuable ways to address poverty among farming families and reduce their<b> vulnerability </b>to agriculture shocks.  However, some commentators responded that cash transfers to poor families do not necessarily translate into increased food security, as these programmes do not always<b> strengthen </b><b>food production</b> or raise incomes.","Regarding state<b> subsidies </b>for agriculture, Rokeya Kabir, Executive Director of Bangladesh Nari Progati Sangha, commented in her essay that these ‘<b>have no</b>t compensated for the stranglehold exercised by private traders.","In fact, <b>studies show</b> that sixty percent of beneficiaries of<b> subsidies </b>are not poor, but rich landowners and non-farmer traders.","<b>F</b>","Nwanze, Murphy and Fan argued that private risk management tools, like private insurance, commodity futures markets, and rural finance can help small-scale producers<b> mitigate </b>risk and allow for investment in improvements.  Kabir warned that financial support schemes often encourage the adoption of high-input agricultural practices, which in the medium term may raise production costs beyond the value of their harvests.","Murphy noted that when futures markets become excessively financialised they can contribute to short-term <b>price volatility</b>, which increases farmers’ food insecurity. Many participants and commentators<b> emphasised </b>that greater<b> transparency </b>in markets is needed to<b> mitigate </b>the impact of volatility, and make evident whether adequate stocks and supplies are available. Others contended that agribusiness companies should be held<b> responsible </b>for paying for negative <b>side effects</b>.","<b>G</b>","Many essayists mentioned <b>climate change</b> and its consequences for small-scale agriculture. Fan explained that in addition to reducing <b>crop yields</b>, <b>climate change</b> increases the<b> magnitude </b>and the frequency of extreme weather events, which increase<b> smallholder </b>vulnerability. The growing<b> unpredictability </b>of weather patterns increases farmers’ difficulty in managing weather-related risks.","According to this author, one solution would be to develop crop varieties that are more<b> resilient </b>to new climate trends and extreme weather patterns. Accordingly, Pat Mooney, co-founder and executive director of the ETC Group, suggested that ‘if we are to survive <b>climate change</b>, we must adopt policies that let<b> peasants </b>diversify the plant and animal<b> species </b>and varieties/breeds that <b>make up</b> our menus.","<b>H</b>","Some participating authors and commentators argued in favour of community- based and autonomous risk management strategies through collective action groups, co-operatives or producers’ groups. Such groups enhance market<b> opportunities </b>for small-scale producers, reduce marketing costs and synchronise <b>buying and selling</b> with<b> seasonal </b>price conditions.","According to Murphy, ‘collective action offers an important way for farmers to<b> strengthen </b>their political and economic bargaining power, and to reduce their business risks. One commentator, Giel Ton, warned that collective action does not come as a free good. It takes time, effort and money to organise, build trust and to experiment. Others, like Marcel Vernooij and Marcel Beukeboom, suggested that in order to ‘apply what we <b>already know</b>’, all stakeholders, including business, government, scientists and civil society, must <b>work together</b>, starting at the beginning of the value chain.","<b>I</b>","Some participants explained that market <b>price volatility</b> is often worsened by the presence of intermediary purchasers who, taking advantage of farmers’ vulnerability, dictate prices. One commentator suggested farmers can gain greater control over prices and minimise <b>price volatility</b> by selling directly to consumers.","Similarly, Sonali Bisht, founder and advisor to the Institute of Himalayan Environmental Research and Education (INHERE), India, wrote that copipunity-supported agriculture, where consumers invest in <b>local farmers</b> by subscription and<b> guarantee </b>producers a fair price, is a risk-sharing model worth more attention.

His goal was to locate the remains of a city called Vitcos, the last capital of the Inca civilisation.","Cusco lies on a high<b> plateau </b>at an elevation of more than 3,000 metres, and Bingham’s plan was to descend from this<b> plateau </b>along the valley of the Urubamba river, which takes a circuitous route down to the Amazon and passes through an area of dramatic canyons and mountain ranges.","<b>B</b>","When Bingham and his team set off down the Urubamba in late July, they had an advantage over travellers who had<b> preceded </b>them: a track had recently been<b> blasted </b>down the valley<b> canyon </b>to enable rubber to be brought up by<b> mules </b>from the jungle. <b>Almost all</b> previous travellers had left the river at Ollantaytambo and taken a high pass across the mountains to rejoin the river lower down, thereby cutting a<b> substantial </b>corner, but also therefore never passing through the area around <b>Machu Picchu</b>.","<b>C</b>","On 24 July they were a <b>few days</b> into their descent of the valley. The day began slowly, with Bingham trying to arrange sufficient<b> mules </b>for the <b>next stage</b> of the trek. His<b> companions </b>showed no interest in accompanying him up the nearby hill to <b>see some</b> ruins that a local farmer, Melchor Arteaga, had told them about the night before. The morning was dull and damp, and Bingham also <b>seems to have</b> been less than keen on the prospect of climbing the hill. In his book <b>Lost City</b> of the Incas, he relates that he made the ascent without having the least expectation that he would <b>find anything</b> at the top.","<b>D</b>","Bingham writes about the approach in vivid style in his book. First, as he <b>climbs up</b> the hill, he describes the ever-present possibility of deadly snakes, ‘capable of making considerable springs when in pursuit of their prey’; not that he sees any. Then there’s a sense of<b> mounting </b>discovery as he comes across great sweeps of terraces, then a mausoleum, followed by<b> monumental </b>staircases and, finally, the grand ceremonial buildings of <b>Machu Picchu</b>. ‘It seemed like an unbelievable dream the sight held me spellbound ’, he wrote.","<b>E</b>","We should remember, however, that <b>Lost City</b> of the Incas is a work of hindsight, not written until 1948, many years after his journey. His journal entries of the time reveal a much more gradual appreciation of his achievement. He spent the afternoon at the ruins noting down the dimensions of some of the buildings, then descended and rejoined his companions, to whom he <b>seems to have</b> said little about his discovery. At this stage, Bingham didn’t realise the extent or the importance of the site, nor did he realise what use he could make of the discovery.","<b>F</b>","However, soon after returning it<b> occurred </b>to him that he could make a name for himself from this discovery. When he came to write the National Geographic magazine article that broke the story to the world in April 1913, he knew he had to produce a big idea.","He wondered whether it could have been the birthplace of the <b>very first</b> Inca, Manco the Great, and whether it could <b>also have</b> been what<b> chroniclers </b>described as ‘the last city of the Incas’. This term<b> refers </b>to Vilcabamba the settlement where the Incas had fled from Spanish invaders in the 1530s. Bingham made<b> desperate </b>attempts to prove this belief for nearly 40 years. Sadly, his vision of the site as both the <b>beginning and end</b> of the Inca civilisation, while a magnificent one, is inaccurate. We now know, that Vilcabamba actually lies 65 kilometres away in the depths of the jungle.","<b>G</b>","One question that has<b> perplexed </b>visitors, historians and archaeologists alike <b>ever since</b> Bingham, is why the site <b>seems to have</b> been abandoned before the Spanish Conquest. There are no<b> references </b>to it by any of the Spanish<b> chroniclers </b>– and if they had known of its existence so close to Cusco they would <b>certainly have</b> come in search of gold.","An idea which has gained wide acceptance over the past <b>few years</b> is that <b>Machu Picchu</b> was a moya, a country<b> estate </b>built by an Inca<b> emperor </b>to escape the cold winters of Cusco, where the elite could enjoy<b> monumental </b>architecture and <b>spectacular views</b>. Furthermore, the particular architecture of <b>Machu Picchu</b> suggests that it was constructed at the time of the greatest of all the Incas, the<b> emperor </b>Pachacuti (1438-71). By custom, Pachacuti’s<b> descendants </b>built other similar estates for their own use, and so <b>Machu Picchu</b> would have been abandoned after his death, some 50 years before the Spanish Conquest."]},{"name":"ARE/12-2-3","paragraph":["<h2>The Benefits of Being Bilingual</h2>","<b>A</b>","According to the latest figures, the majority of the world’s population is now bilingual or multilingual, having grown up speaking two or more languages. In the past, such children were considered to be at a disadvantage compared with their<b> monolingual </b>peers. Over the past <b>few decades</b>, however, technological advances have <b>allowed researchers</b> to look more deeply at how<b> bilingualism </b>interacts with and changes the cognitive and<b> neurological </b>systems, thereby identifying several clear benefits of being bilingual.","<b>B</b>","<b>Research shows</b> that when a bilingual person uses one language, the other is active at the <b>same time</b>. When we hear a word, we don’t hear the entire word all at once: the sounds arrive in sequential order. Long before the word is finished, the brain’s language system begins to guess what that word might be. If you hear ‘can’, you will likely activate words like ‘candy’ and ‘candle’ as well, at least during the earlier stages of word recognition. For bilingual people, this activation is not limited to a single language;<b> auditory </b>input activates<b> corresponding </b>words regardless of the language to which they belong. <b>Some of the most</b> compelling evidence for this phenomenon, called ‘language co-activation’, comes from studying eye movements. A Russian-English bilingual asked to ‘<b>pick up</b> a marker’ from a set of objects would look more at a stamp than someone who doesn’t know Russian, because the Russian word for ‘stamp’, marka, <b>sounds like</b> the English word he or she heard, ‘marker’. In cases like this, language co-activation occurs because what the listener hears could map onto words in either language.","<b>C</b>","Having to deal with this persistent<b> linguistic </b>competition can result in difficulties, however. For instance, knowing more than one language can cause speakers to name pictures more slowly, and can increase ‘tip-of-the-tongue states’, when you can almost, but not quite, bring a word to mind. As a result, the constant juggling of two languages creates a need to control how much a person accesses a language at <b>any <b>given time</b></b>. For this reason, bilingual <b>people often</b> perform better on tasks that require conflict management. In the classic Stroop Task, <b>people see</b> a word and are asked to name the colour of the word’s font. When the colour and the word match (i., the word ‘red’ printed in red), people correctly name the colour more quickly than when the colour and the word don’t match (i., the word ‘red’ printed in blue). This occurs because the word itself (‘red’) and its font colour (blue) conflict. Bilingual <b>people often</b> excel at tasks such as this, which tap into the ability to ignore competing<b> perceptual </b>information and focus on the<b> relevant </b>aspects of the input. Bilinguals are also better at switching between two tasks; for example, when bilinguals have to switch from categorizing objects by colour (red or green) to categorizing them by shape (circle or triangle), they do so more quickly than<b> monolingual </b>people, reflecting better cognitive control when having to make rapid changes of strategy.","<b>D</b>","It <b><b>also see</b>ms</b> that the<b> neurological </b>roots of the bilingual advantage extend to <b>brain areas</b> more traditionally associated with<b> sensory </b>processing. When<b> monolingual </b>and bilingual adolescents listen to simple speech sounds without any intervening background noise, they show highly similar brain<b> stem </b>responses. When researchers play the same sound to both groups in the presence of background noise, however, the bilingual listeners’<b> neural </b>response is considerably larger, reflecting better encoding of the sound’s fundamental frequency, a feature of sound closely related to<b> pitch </b>perception.","<b>E</b>","Such improvements in cognitive and<b> sensory </b>processing may help a bilingual person to process information in the environment, and help explain why bilingual adults acquire a third language better than<b> monolingual </b>adults master a second language. This advantage may be rooted in the skill of focussing on information about the new language while reducing interference from the languages they <b>already know</b>.","<b>F</b>","<b>Research also</b> indicates that bilingual experience may help to keep the cognitive mechanisms sharp by recruiting alternate brain networks to compensate for those that become damaged during aging. Older bilinguals enjoy improved memory relative to<b> monolingual </b>people, which can lead to real-world <b>health benefits</b>. In a study of over 200 patients with Alzheimer’s disease, a degenerative brain disease, bilingual patients reported showing initial<b> symptoms </b>of the disease an average of <b>five <b>years later</b></b> than<b> monolingual </b>patients. In a follow-up study, researchers compared the brains of bilingual and<b> monolingual </b>patients matched on the<b> severity </b>of Alzheimer’s symptoms. Surprisingly, the bilinguals’ brains had more physical signs of disease than their<b> monolingual </b>counterparts, <b>even though</b> their<b> outward </b>behaviour and abilities were the same. If the brain is an engine,<b> bilingualism </b>may help it to go farther on the same amount of fuel.","<b>G</b>","Furthermore, the benefits associated with bilingual experience seem to start <b>very early</b>. In <b>one study</b>, researchers taught seven-month-old babies growing up in<b> monolingual </b>or bilingual homes that when they heard a tinkling sound, a puppet appeared on <b>one side</b> of a screen. Halfway through the study, the puppet began appearing on the <b>opposite side</b> of the screen. In <b>order to get</b> a reward, the infants had to adjust the rule they’d learned; only the bilingual babies were able to successfully learn the new rule. This suggests that for very <b>young children</b>, as well as for <b>older people</b>, navigating a multilingual environment imparts advantages that transfer far beyond language."]},{"name":"ARE/12-3-1","paragraph":["<h2>Flying Tortoises</h2>","An airborne<b> reintroduction </b><b>programme has</b> helped<b> conservationists </b>take significant steps to protect the endangered Galapagos tortoise.","<b>A</b>","Forests of spiny<b> cacti </b>cover much of the uneven lava plains that separate the interior of the Galapagos island of Isabela from the <b>Pacific Ocean</b>. With its five distinct volcanoes, the island<b> resembles </b>a lunar landscape. Only the <b>thick vegetation</b> at the skirt of the often cloud-covered peak of Sierra Negra offers<b> respite </b>from the barren<b> terrain </b>below.","This inhospitable environment is home to the giant Galapagos tortoise. <b>Some time</b> after the Galapagos’s birth, around five <b>million years</b> ago, the islands were colonised by one or more tortoises from mainland <b>South America</b>. As these<b> ancestral </b>tortoises settled on the individual islands, the different populations adapted to their unique environments, giving rise to at least 14 different subspecies. Island life agreed with them. In the absence of significant predators, they grew to become the largest and longest-living tortoises on the planet, weighing more than 400 kilograms, occasionally exceeding 1,8 metres in length and living for more than a century.","<b>B</b>","Before human arrival, the archipelago’s tortoises numbered in the hundreds of thousands. From the 17th century onwards, pirates took a few on board for food, but the arrival of whaling ships in the 1790s saw this<b> exploitation </b>grow exponentially. Relatively<b> immobile </b>and capable of surviving for months without food or water, the tortoises were taken on board these ships to act as food supplies during long ocean passages. Sometimes, their bodies were processed into high- grade oil.","In total, an<b> estimated </b>200,000 animals were taken from the<b> archipelago </b>before the 20th century. This historical<b> exploitation </b>was then exacerbated when settlers came to the islands. They hunted the tortoises and destroyed their habitat to clear land for agriculture. They <b>also introduced</b> alien<b> species </b>– ranging from cattle, pigs, goats, rats and dogs to plants and ants – that either<b> prey </b>on the eggs and young tortoises or damage or destroy their habitat.","<b>C</b>","Today, only 11 of the original<b> subspecies </b>survive and of these, several are highly endangered. In 1989, work began on a tortoise-breeding centre <b>just outside</b> the town of Puerto Villamil on Isabela, dedicated to protecting the island’s tortoise populations. The centre’s captive-breeding programme proved to be extremely successful, and it eventually had to deal with an overpopulation problem.","<b>D</b>","The problem was also a pressing one. Captive-bred tortoises can’t be reintroduced into the wild until they’re at least <b><b>five years</b> old</b> and weigh at least 4,5 kilograms, at which point their size and weight – and their hardened shells – are sufficient to protect them from predators. But if people wait <b>too long</b> after that point, the tortoises eventually beco<b>me too</b> large to transport.","<b>E</b>","For years, repatriation efforts were carried out in <b>small number</b>s, with the tortoises carried on the backs of men over weeks of long, treacherous hikes along narrow trails. But in November 2010, the environmentalist and Galapagos <b>National Park</b> liaison officer Godfrey Merlin, a visiting private motor<b> yacht </b>captain and a helicopter pilot gathered around a table in a small cafe in Puerto Ayora on the island of Santa Cruz to work out more ambitious reintroduction. The aim was to use a helicopter to move 300 of the breeding centre’s tortoises to various locations close to Sierra Negra.","<b>F</b>","This unprecedented effort was <b>made possible</b> by the owners of the 67-metre<b> yacht </b>White Cloud, who provided the Galapagos <b>National Park</b> with free use of their helicopter and its experienced pilot, as well as the logistical support of the yacht, its captain and crew. Originally an air ambulance, the yacht’s helicopter has a rear double door and a large internal space that’s well suited for cargo, so a custom crate was designed to <b>hold up</b> to 33 tortoises with a total weight of about 150 kilograms. This weight, together with that of the fuel, pilot and four crew, approached the helicopter’s maximum payload, and there were times when it was clearly right on the edge of the helicopter’s capabilities. During a period of <b>three days</b>, a group of volunteers from the breeding centre worked around the clock to prepare the young tortoises for transport.

In a world that is far more globalised than ever before, <b>people come</b> into contact with <b>one another</b> through travel and living closer and closer to <b>each other</b>. As a result, super-viruses and other infections<b> resistant </b>to antibiotics are becoming more and more common.","<b>B</b>","Geography can often play a <b>very large</b> role in the health concerns of certain populations. For instance, depending on where you live, you will not <b>have the same</b> health concerns as someone who lives in a different<b> geographical </b>region. Perhaps <b>one of the most</b> obvious examples of this idea is malaria-pr<b>one area</b>s, which are usually tropical regions that<b> foster </b>a warm and damp environment in which the mosquitos that can <b>give people</b> this disease can grow.<b> Malaria </b>is <b>much less</b> of a problem in high-altitude deserts, for instance.","<b>C</b>","In some countries,<b> geographical </b>factors influence the health and well-being of the population in very obvious ways. In many large cities, the wind is not <b>strong enough</b> to clear the air of the massive amounts of smog and<b> pollution </b>that cause asthma, lung problems, eyesight issues and more in the people who live there. Part of the problem is, of course, the massive <b>number of cars</b> being driven, in addition to factories that run on coal power. The rapid<b> industrialisation </b>of some countries in <b>recent years</b> <b>has also</b> led to the <b>cutting down</b> of forests to allow for the expansion of big cities, which makes it even harder to fight the<b> pollution </b>with the <b>fresh air</b> that is produced by plants.","<b>D</b>","It is in situations like these that the field of <b>health geography</b> comes into its own. It is an increasingly <b>important area</b> of study in a world where diseases like polio are re-emerging,<b> respiratory </b>diseases continue to spread, and malaria-pr<b>one area</b>s are still fighting to find a better cure. <b>Health geography</b> is the combination of, on the one hand, knowledge regarding<b> geography </b>and methods used to analyse and interpret<b> geographical </b>information, and on the other, the study of health, diseases and healthcare practices a<b>round the world</b>. The aim of this hybrid science is to create solutions for common geography-based <b>health problems</b>. While people will always be prone to illness, the study of how<b> geography </b>affects our health could <b>lead to the eradication</b> of certain illnesses, and the prevention of others in the future. By understanding why and how we get sick, we can <b>change the way</b> we treat<b> illness </b>and disease specific to certain<b> geographical </b>locations.","<b>E</b>","The<b> geography </b>of disease and ill health analyses the frequency with which certain diseases appear in <b>different <b>parts of the world</b></b>, and overlays the data with the<b> geography </b>of the region, to see if there could be a correlation between the two. <b>Health geographers</b> also study factors that could make certain individuals or a population more likely to be taken ill with a specific health concern or disease, as compared with the population of another area. <b>Health geographers</b> in this field are usually trained as healthcare workers, and have an understanding of basic epidemiology as it relates to the spread of diseases among the population.","<b>F</b>","Researchers study the interactions between humans and their environment that could lead to<b> illness </b>(such as<b> asthma </b>in places with <b><b>high level</b>s</b> of pollution) and work to create a clear way of categorising illnesses, diseases and<b> epidemics </b>into local and global scales. <b>Health geographers</b> can map the spread of illnesses and attempt to identify the reasons behind an increase or decrease in illnesses, as they work to find a way to halt the further spread or re-emergence of diseases in<b> vulnerable </b>populations.","<b>G</b>","The second subcategory of <b>health geography</b> is the<b> geography </b>of healthcare provision. This group studies the availability (of lack thereof) of healthcare resources to individuals and populations a<b>round the world</b>. In both developed and developing nations, there is often a <b>very large</b> discrepancy between the options available to <b>people in different</b><b> social </b>classes, income brackets, and levels of education. Individuals working in the area of the<b> geography </b>of healthcare<b> provision </b>attempt to assess the levels of healthcare in the area (for instance, it may be <b>very difficult</b> for people to get medical attention because there is a mountain between their village and the nearest hospital).

On the one hand, music is a purely abstract <b>art form</b>,<b> devoid </b>of language or explicit ideas. And yet, <b>even though</b> music says little, it still manages to touch us deeply. When listening to our favourite songs, our body betrays all the<b> symptoms </b>of emotional arousal. The pupils in our eyes dilate, our pulse and blood pressure rise, the electrical conductance of our skin is lowered, and the cerebellum, a brain region associated with bodily movement, becomes strangely active. Blood is even re-directed to the muscles in our legs. In other words, sound stirs us at our biological roots.","<b>A </b> <b>recent paper</b> in<b> Neuroscience </b>by a research team in Montreal, Canada, marks an important step in repealing the precise underpinnings of ‘the<b> potent </b>pleasurable stimulus’ that is music. Although the study involves plenty of fancy technology, including functional magnetic<b> resonance </b>imaging (fMRI) and ligand-based positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, the experiment itself was rather straightforward. After<b> screening </b>217 individuals who responded to advertisements requesting people who experience ‘chills’ to instrumental music, the scientists narrowed down the subject pool to ten.","They then asked the subjects to bring in their playlist of favourite songs – <b>virtually every</b><b> genre </b>was represented, from techno to tango – and played them the music while their brain activity was monitored. Because the scientists were combining methodologies (PET and fMRI), they were able to obtain an<b> impressively </b>exact and detailed<b> portrait </b>of music in the brain. The <b>first thing</b> they discovered is that music triggers the production of<b> dopamine </b>– a chemical with a <b>key role</b> in setting people’s moods – by the<b> neurons </b>(nerve cells) in both the<b> dorsal </b>and ventral regions of the brain. As these two regions <b>have long</b> been linked with the experience of pleasure, this finding isn’t particularly surprising.","What is rather more significant is the finding that the <b>dopamine neurons</b> in the<b> caudate </b>– a region of the brain involved in learning stimulus-response associations, and in anticipating food and other ‘reward’<b> stimuli </b>– were at their <b>most active</b> around 15 seconds before the participants’ favourite moments in the music. The researchers call this the ‘anticipatory phase’ and argue that the purpose of this activity is to help us predict the arrival of our favourite part. The question, of course, is what all these <b>dopamine neurons</b> are up to.","Why are they so active in the period preceding the acoustic climax? After all, we typically associate surges of<b> dopamine </b>with pleasure, with the processing of actual rewards. And yet, this cluster of cells is <b>most active</b> when the ‘chills’ have yet to arrive, when the melodic pattern is still unresolved.","<b>One way</b> to answer the question is to look at the music and not the neurons. While music can often seem (at least to the outsider) like a labyrinth of<b> intricate </b>patterns, it turns out that the <b>most <b>important part</b></b> of every song or<b> symphony </b>is when the patterns break down, when the sound becomes unpredictable. If the music is too obvious, it is annoyingly boring, like an alarm clock.","Numerous studies, after all, have demonstrated that <b>dopamine neurons</b> quickly adapt to predictable rewards. If we know what’s going to happen next, then we don’t get excited. This is why<b> composers </b>often introduce a key note in the beginning of a song, spend most of the rest of the piece in the studious avoidance of the pattern, and then finally repeat it only at the end. The longer we are denied the pattern we expect, the greater the emotional release when the pattern returns, safe and sound.","To demonstrate this<b> psychological </b>principle, the musicologist Leonard Meyer, in his classic book Emotion and Meaning in Music (1956), analysed the 5th movement of Beethoven’s String Quartet in C-sharp minor, Op. 131. Meyer wanted to show how music is defined by its flirtation with – but not submission to – our expectations of order. Meyer<b> dissected </b>50 measures (bars) of the masterpiece, showing how Beethoven begins with the clear statement of a rhythmic and harmonic pattern and then, in an<b> ingenious </b>tonal dance, carefully holds off repeating it. What Beethoven does instead suggest variations of the pattern. I want to<b> preserve </b>an element of uncertainty in his music, making our brains beg for the one chord he <b>refuses to give</b> us. Beethoven saves that chord for the end.","According to Meyer, it is the suspenseful tension of music, arising out of our unfulfilled expectations, that is the source of the music’s feeling. While earlier theories of music focused on the way a sound can refer to the real world of images and experiences – its ‘connotative’ meaning – Meyer argued that the emotions we find in music come from the unfolding events of the music itself. This ‘embodied meaning’ arises from the patterns the<b> symphony </b>invokes and then ignores. It is this uncertainty that triggers the surge of<b> dopamine </b>in the caudate, as we struggle to figure out what will happen next. We can predict some of the notes, but we can’t predict them all, and that is what keeps us listening, waiting expectantly for our reward, for the pattern to be completed."]},{"name":"ARE/12-4-1","paragraph":["<h2>The History of Glass</h2>","From our earliest origins, man has been <b>making use</b> of glass. Historians <b>have discovered</b> that a type of natural glass – obsidian – formed in places such as the mouth of a volcano as a result of the intense heat of an<b> eruption </b>melting sand – was first used as tips for spears. Archaeologists have even <b>found evidence</b> of man-made glass which <b>dates back</b> to 4000 BC; this took the form of glazes used for coating stone beads. It was not until 1500 BC, however, that the first<b> hollow </b>glass container was made by covering a sand core with a layer of molten glass.","Glass blowing became the most common way to make <b>glass containers</b> from the <b>first century</b> BC. The glass made during this time was highly coloured due to the impurities of the <b>raw material</b>. In the <b>first century</b> AD, methods of creating colourless glass were developed, which was then tinted by the addition of colouring materials. The secret of <b>glass making</b> was taken across Europe by the Romans during this century. However, they guarded the skills and technology <b>required to make</b> glass <b>very close</b>ly, and it was not until their empire collapsed in 476 AD that glass-making knowledge became widespread <b>throughout Europe</b> and the <b>Middle East</b>. From the 10th century onwards, the Venetians gained a reputation for technical skill and artistic ability in the making of glass bottles, and many of the city’s<b> craftsmen </b>left Italy to <b>set up</b> glassworks <b>throughout Europe</b>.","<b>A </b> major milestone in the history of glass<b> occurred </b>with the invention of lead crystal glass by the English glass manufacturer George Ravenscroft (1632 – 1683). He attempted to counter the effect of clouding that sometimes<b> occurred </b>in blown glass by introducing lead to the <b><b>raw material</b>s</b> used in the process. The new glass he created was softer and easier to decorate, and had a higher refractive index, adding to its brilliance and beauty, and it proved<b> invaluable </b>to the<b> optical </b>industry. It is thanks to Ravenscroft’s invention that<b> optical </b>lenses, astronomical telescopes,<b> microscopes </b>and the like became possible.","In Britain, the modem glass industry only really started to develop after the repeal of the Excise Act in 1845. Before that time, heavy taxes had been placed on the amount of glass melted in a glasshouse, and were levied continuously from 1745 to 1845. Joseph Paxton’s Crystal Palace at London’s Great Exhibition of 1851 marked the beginning of glass as a material used in the building industry. This<b> revolutionary </b><b>new building</b> encouraged the use of glass in public, domestic and horticultural architecture. Glass manufacturing techniques also improved with the advancement of science and the development of better technology.","From 1887 onwards, <b>glass making</b> developed from traditional mouth-blowing to a semi-automatic process, after factory- owner HM Ashley introduced a machine capable of producing 200 bottles <b>per hour</b> in Castleford, Yorkshire, England – more than <b>three times</b> quicker than <b>any previous</b> production method. Then in 1907, the first fully automated machine was developed in the USA by Michael Owens – founder of the Owens Bottle Machine Company (later the <b>major manufacturers</b> Owens- Illinois) – and installed in its factory. Owens’ invention could produce an<b> impressive </b>2,500 bottles <b>per hour</b> <b>Other developments</b> followed rapidly, but it | was not until the <b><b>First World</b> War</b> when Britain became cut off from essential glass suppliers, that glass <b>became part</b> of the scientific sector. Previous to this, glass had been seen as a<b> craft </b>rather than a precise science.","Today, <b>glass making</b> is <b>big business</b>. It <b>has become</b> a modem, hi-tech industry operating in a fiercely competitive global market where quality, design and service levels are critical to maintaining <b>market share</b>. Modem glass plants are capable of making millions of <b>glass containers</b> a day in <b>many different</b> colours, with green, brown and clear remaining the <b>most popular</b>. Few of us can imagine modem life without glass. It features in <b>almost every</b> aspect of our lives – in our homes, our cars and whenever we sit down to eat or drink. Glass packaging is used for many products, many beverages are sold in glass, as are<b> numerous </b>foodstuffs, as well as medicines and cosmetics.","Glass is an ideal material for recycling, and with growing consumer concern for green issues, glass bottles and<b> jars </b>are becoming ever more popular. Glass<b> recycling </b>is <b>good news</b> for the environment. It saves used <b>glass containers</b> being sent to landfill. As less energy is needed to melt<b> recycled </b>glass than to melt down <b><b>raw material</b>s</b>, this also saves<b> fuel </b>and production costs.<b> Recycling </b><b>also reduces</b> the need for <b><b>raw material</b>s</b> to be quarried, thus saving <b>precious resources</b>."]},{"name":"ARE/12-4-2","paragraph":["<h2>Bring back the big cats</h2>","It’s <b>time to start</b> returning<b> vanished </b>native animals to Britain, says John Vesty There is a poem, written around 598 AD, which describes<b> hunting </b>a<b> mystery </b>animal called a llewyn. But what was it? Nothing seemed to fit, until 2006, when an animal bone, dating from around the same period, was found in the Kinsey Cave in northern England. Until this discovery, the<b> lynx </b>– a large spotted cat with<b> tassel </b>led ears – was presumed to <b>have died</b> out in Britain at least 6,000 <b>years ago</b>, before the<b> inhabitants </b>of these islands <b>took up</b> farming. But the 2006 find, together with three others in Yorkshire and Scotland, is compelling evidence that the<b> lynx </b>and the<b> mysterious </b>llewyn were, in fact, one and the same animal. If this is so, it would bring forward the tassel-eared cat’s<b> estimated </b>extinction date by roughly 5,000 years.","However, this is not quite the last glimpse of the animal in British culture. A 9th- century stone cross from the Isle of Eigg shows, alongside the deer, boar and aurochs pursued by a<b> mounted </b>hunter, a speckled cat with tasselled ears. Were it not for the animal’s backside having worn away with time, we could have been certain, as the lynx’s stubby tail is unmistakable. But even without this key feature, it’s <b>hard to see</b> what else the creature could have been. The<b> lynx </b>is now becoming the totemic animal of a movement that is transforming British environmentalism: rewilding.","Rewilding means the mass<b> restoration </b>of damaged ecosystems. It involves letting trees return to places that have been denuded, allowing parts of the<b> seabed </b>to recover from trawling and dredging, permitting rivers to flow freely again. Above all, it means bringing back missing species. <b>One of the most</b> striking findings of modern<b> ecology </b>is that ecosystems without <b>large predators</b> behave in <b>completely different</b> ways from those that retain them Some of them drive dynamic processes that<b> resonate </b>through the whole food chain, creating<b> niches </b>for hundreds of<b> species </b>that might otherwise struggle to survive. The killers turn out to be bringers of life.","Such findings present a big challenge to British conservation, which has often selected arbitrary assemblages of plants and animals and sought, at great effort and expense, to prevent them from changing. It has tried to<b> preserve </b>the living world as if it were a<b> jar </b>of pickles, letting nothing in and nothing out, keeping nature in a state of arrested development. But ecosystems are not merely collections of species; they are also the dynamic and ever-shifting relationships between them. And this dynamism often depends on <b>large predators</b>.","At sea the potential is even greater: by protecting <b>large areas</b> from commercial fishing, we could once more see what 18th-century literature describes: vast shoals of fish being chased by fin and<b> sperm </b>whales, within sight of the English shore. This policy would also greatly boost catches in the surrounding seas; the <b>fishing industry</b>’s insistence on scouring every inch of seabed, leaving no breeding reserves, could not be more damaging to its own interests.","Rewilding is a rare example of an environmental movement in which campaigners<b> articulate </b>what they are for rather than only what they are against. One of the reasons why the<b> enthusiasm </b>for<b> rewilding </b>is spreading so quickly in Britain is that it helps to create a more inspiring vision than the green movement’s usual promise of ‘Follow us and the world will be slightly less awful than it would otherwise have been.","The<b> lynx </b>presents no threat to <b>human beings</b>: there is no known instance of one<b> preying </b>on people. It is a<b> specialist </b>predator of roe deer, a<b> species </b>that has exploded in Britain in recent decades, holding back, by intensive browsing, attempts to re-establish forests. It will also winkle out sika deer: an exotic<b> species </b>that is almost impossible for <b>human beings</b> to control, as it hides in impenetrable<b> plantations </b>of young trees. The attempt to reintroduce this predator marries well with the aim of bringing forests back to parts of our bare and<b> barren </b>uplands. The<b> lynx </b>requires deep cover, and as such presents little risk to sheep and other livestock, which are supposed, as a condition of farm subsidies, to be kept out of the woods.","On a recent trip to the Cairngorm Mountains, I heard several<b> conservationists </b>suggest that the<b> lynx </b>could be reintroduced there within 20 years. If trees return to the bare hills elsewhere in Britain, the big cats could soon follow. There is nothing extraordinary about these proposals, seen from the<b> perspective </b>of anywhere else in Europe. The<b> lynx </b><b><b>has no</b>w</b> been reintroduced to the Jura Mountains, the Alps, the Vosges in eastern France and the Harz mountains in Germany, and has re-established itself in many more places. The European <b>population has</b> tripled since 1970 to roughly 10,000. As with wolves, bears, beavers, boar, bison, moose and many <b>other species</b>, the<b> lynx </b>has been able to spread as farming has, left the hills and people discover that it is more lucrative to protect charismatic wildlife than to hunt it, as tourists will pay for the chance to see it. Large-scale<b> rewilding </b>is happening <b>almost every</b>where – except Britain.","Here, attitudes are just beginning to change.<b> Conservationists </b>are starting to accept that the old preservation-jar model is failing, even on its own terms. Already, <b>projects such</b> as Trees for Life in the Highlands provide a hint of what might be coming.

It is clear that the role of a board director today is not an easy one. Following the 2008 financial meltdown, which resulted in a deeper and more prolonged period of economic downturn than anyone expected, the search for explanations in the many post-mortems of the crisis has meant blame has been spread far and wide. Governments, regulators, central banks and auditors <b>have all</b> been in the frame. The role of bank directors and management and their <b>widely publicised</b> failures have been extensively picked over and examined in reports, inquiries and commentaries.","<b>B.</b>  The knock-on t of this<b> scrutiny </b>has been to make the<b> governance </b>of companies in general an issue of intense public debate and has significantly increased the pressures on, and the<b> responsibilities </b>of, directors. At the<b> simplest </b>and <b>most practical</b> level, the time involved in<b> fulfilling </b>the demands of a board directorship <b>has increased</b> significantly, calling into question the effectiveness of the classic model of corporate<b> governance </b>by part-time, independent non-executive directors. Where once a board schedule may have consisted of between eight and ten meetings a year, in many companies the number of events requiring board input and decisions has dramatically risen. Furthermore, the amount of reading and preparation required for each meeting is increasing. Agendas can become<b> overloaded </b>and this can mean the time for constructive debate must necessarily be restricted in favour of getting through the business.","<b>C.</b>  Often, board business is devolved to committees in order to cope with the workload, which may be more efficient but can mean that the board as a whole is less involved in fully addressing <b>some of the most</b> <b>important issues</b>. It is not uncommon for the audit<b> committee </b>meeting to <b>last long</b>er than the main board meeting itself. The process may take the place of discussion and be at the expense of real collaboration, so that boxes are ticked rather than issues tackled.","<b>D.</b>  A<b> radical </b>solution, which may <b>work for some</b> <b>very large</b> companies whose businesses are extensive and complex, is the professional board, whose members would <b>work up</b> to <b>three or four</b> <b>days a week</b>, supported by their own dedicated staff and advisers. There are obvious risks to this and it would be important to establish clear guidelines for such a board to ensure that it did not step on the<b> toes </b>of management by becoming too engaged in the day-to-day running of the company. Problems of recruitment,<b> remuneration </b>and independence could also arise and this structure would not be appropriate for all companies. However, more professional and better-informed boards would <b>have been particularly</b> appropriate for banks where the executives <b>had access</b> to information that part-time non-executive directors lacked, leaving the<b> latter </b>unable to<b> comprehend </b>or anticipate the 2008 crash.","<b>E.</b>  <b>One of the main</b> criticisms of boards and their directors is that they do not focus sufficiently on longer-term matters of strategy, sustainability and governance, but instead<b> concentrate </b><b>too much</b> on short-term financial metrics. Regulatory requirements and the structure of the market encourage this behaviour. The tyranny of<b> quarterly </b>reporting can distort board decision-making, as directors have to ‘make the numbers’ every <b>four months</b> to meet the insatiable appetite of the market for more data. This serves to encourage the trading methodology of a certain kind of investor who moves in and out of a stock without engaging in constructive dialogue with the company about strategy or performance, and is simply seeking a short¬ term financial gain. This effect <b>has been made</b> worse by the changing profile of investors due to the globalisation of capital and the increasing use of automated trading systems. Corporate culture adapts and management teams are largely incentivised to meet financial goals.","<b>F.</b> <b> Compensation </b>for <b><b>chief executive</b>s</b> <b>has become</b> a combat zone where<b> pitched </b>battles between investors, management and <b>board members</b> are fought, often behind closed doors but increasingly frequently in the full glare of press attention. Many would argue that this is in the interest of<b> transparency </b>and good<b> governance </b>as shareholders use their muscle in the area of pay to pressure boards to remove underperforming <b><b>chief executive</b>s</b>. Their powers to vote down executive<b> remuneration </b>policies increased when binding votes came into force. The chair of the<b> remuneration </b>committee can be an exposed and lonely role, as Alison Carnwath, chair of Barclays Bank’s<b> remuneration </b>committee, found when she had to resign, having been roundly criticised for trying to defend the enormous bonus to be paid to the <b>chief executive</b>; the irony being that she was widely understood to have spoken out against it in the privacy of the committee.","<b>G.</b>  The financial crisis stimulated a debate about the role and purpose of the company and a<b> heightened </b>awareness of corporate ethics. Trust in the corporation has been eroded and academics such as Michael Sandel, in his thoughtful and bestselling book What Money Can’t Buy, are questioning the<b> morality </b>of<b> capitalism </b>and the market economy. Boards of companies in all sectors will need to widen their<b> perspective </b>to encompass these issues and this may involve a realignment of corporate goals.

The product is the country itself – the people, the places and the experiences. In 1999, <b>Tourism <b>New Zealand</b></b> launched a campaign to communicate a new brand position to the world. The campaign focused on <b>New Zealand</b>’s scenic beauty, exhilarating <b>outdoor activities</b> and authentic Maori culture, and it made <b>New Zealand</b> one of the strongest national brands in the world.","<b>A </b> key feature of the campaign was the website www.newzealand.com, which provided potential visitors to <b>New Zealand</b> with a single gateway to everything the destination had to offer. The heart of the website was a database of tourism services operators, both those based in <b>New Zealand</b> and those based abroad which offered tourism services to the country. Any tourism-related business could be listed by filling in a simple form. This meant that even the smallest bed and breakfast address or<b> specialist </b>activity provider could gain a web presence with access to an audience of long-haul visitors. In addition, because participating businesses were able to update the details they gave on a <b>regular basis</b>, the information provided remained accurate. And to maintain and improve standards, <b>Tourism <b>New Zealand</b></b> organised a scheme whereby organisations appearing on the website underwent an independent evaluation against a set of agreed national standards of quality. As part of this, the effect of each business on the environment was considered.","To communicate the <b>New Zealand</b> experience, the site also carried features relating to famous people and places. <b><b>One of the most</b> popular</b> was an interview with former <b>New Zealand</b> All Blacks rugby captain Tana Umaga. Another feature that attracted a lot of attention was an interactive journey through a number of the locations chosen for blockbuster films which <b>had made</b> use of <b>New Zealand</b>’s <b>stunning scenery</b> as a backdrop. As the site developed, additional features were added to help independent travellers<b> devise </b>their own customised itineraries. To <b>make it easier</b> to plan motoring holidays, the site catalogued the <b>most popular</b> driving routes in the country, highlighting <b><b>different routes</b> according</b> to the season and indicating distances and times.","Later a Travel Planner feature was added, which allowed visitors to click and ‘bookmark’ : paces or attractions they were interested in, and then view the results on a map.

By registering with the website, users could save their Travel Plan and return to it later, or print it out take on the visit.

But defining boredom so that it can be studied in the lab <b>has proved</b> difficult. For a start, it can include a lot of other mental states, such as frustration, apathy,<b> depression </b>and indifference. There isn’t even agreement over whether Boredom is always a low-energy, flat kind of emotion or whether feeling agitated and restless counts as boredom, too. In his book, Boredom: A Lively History, Peter Toohey at the University of Calgary, Canada, compares it to disgust – an emotion that motivates us to stay away from certain situations. ‘If disgust protects humans from infection, boredom may protect them from “infectious”<b> social </b>situations,’ he suggests.","<b>B </b> By asking people about their experiences of boredom, Thomas Goetz and his team at the University of Konstanz in Ger<b>many have</b> recently identified five distinct types: indifferent, calibrating, searching, reactant and apathetic. These can be plotted on two axes – one <b>running left</b> to right, which measures low to high arousal, and the other from top to bottom, which measures how positive or negative the feeling is. Intriguingly, Goetz <b>has found</b> that while people experience <b>all kinds</b> of boredom, they tend to specialise in one. Of the five types, the most damaging is ‘reactant’ boredom with its explosive combination of high<b> arousal </b>and negative emotion. The <b>most useful</b> is what Goetz calls ‘indifferent’ boredom: someone isn’t engaged in anything satisfying but still feels relaxed and calm. However, it remains to be seen whether there are any character traits that predict the kind of boredom each of us might be prone to.","<b>C </b><b> Psychologist </b>Sandi Mann at the University of Central Lancashire, UK, goes further. All emotions are there for a reason, including boredom,’ she says Mann <b>has found</b> that being bored makes us more creative. ‘We’re all afraid of being bored but in actual fact it can lead to <b>all kinds</b> of amazing things,’ she says. In experiments published <b>last year</b>, Mann <b>found that people</b> who had been made to feel bored by copying numbers out of the phone book for 15 minutes <b>came up</b> with more creative ideas about how to use a polystyrene cup than a control group. Mann concluded that a passive, boring activity is best for creativity because it allows the mind to wander. In fact, she goes so far as to suggest that we should seek out more boredom in our lives.","<b>D </b><b> Psychologist </b>John Eastwood at York University in Toronto, Canada isn’t convinced. ‘If you are in a state of mind-wandering you are not bored,’ he says. ‘In my view, by definition boredom is an undesirable state.’ That doesn’t necessarily mean that it isn’t adaptive, he adds. ‘Pain is adaptive – if we didn’t <b>have physical</b> pain, bad things would happen to us. <b>Does that mean</b> that we should actively cause pain? No. But even if boredom has evolved to help us survive, it can still be toxic if allowed to fester.’ For Eastwood, the <b>central feature</b> of boredom is a failure to put our ‘attention system’ into gear. This causes an<b> inability </b>to focus on anything, which makes time seem to go painfully slowly. What’s more, your efforts to improve the situation can <b>end up</b> making you feel worse. ‘People try to connect with the world and if they are not successful there’s that<b> frustration </b>and irritability,’ he says. Perhaps most worryingly, says Eastwood, repeatedly failing to engage attention can lead to a state where we don’t know what to <b>do any</b> more, and <b>no longer</b> care.","<b>E </b> Eastwood’s <b>team is now</b> trying to explore why the attention system fails. It’s early days but they think that at least some of it <b>comes down</b> to personality. Boredom proneness has been linked with a variety of traits. People who are motivated by pleasure seem to suffer particularly badly. Other <b>personality traits</b>, such as curiosity, are associated with a high boredom threshold. More evidence that boredom has<b> detrimental </b>effects comes from studies of people who are more or less prone to boredom. It seems those who bore easily face poorer prospects in education, their career and even life in general. But of course, boredom itself cannot kill -it’s the things we do to deal with it that may put us in danger. What can we do to alleviate it before it comes to that? Goetz’s group has one suggestion. Working with teenagers, they found that those who ‘approach’ a boring situation – in other words, see that it’s boring and get<b> stuck </b>in anyway – report less boredom than those who <b>try to avoid</b> it by using snacks, TV or <b>social media</b> for distraction.","<b>F </b><b> Psychologist </b>Francoise Wemelsfelder speculates that our over-connected lifestyles might even be a new source of boredom. ‘In modern human society there is a lot of overstimulation but still a <b>lot of problems</b> finding meaning,’ she says. So instead of seeking yet more mental stimulation, perhaps we should leave our phones alone, and use boredom to motivate us to engage with the world in a more meaningful way."]},{"name":"ARE/13-1-3","paragraph":["<h2>Artificial artists</h2>","The <b>Painting Fool</b> is one of a <b>growing number</b> of computer programs which, so their makers claim, possess creative talents. <b>Classical music</b> by an artificial<b> composer </b><b>has had</b> audiences enraptured, and even tricked them into believing a human was behind the score. Artworks painted by a robot have sold for thousands of dollars and been hung in<b> prestigious </b>galleries. And software <b>has been built</b> which creates art that could not have been imagined by the programmer.","<b>Human beings</b> are the only<b> species </b>to perform<b> sophisticated </b>creative acts regularly. If we can break this process down into computer code, where does that leave human creativity? This is a question at the very core of humanity,’ says Geraint Wiggins, a computational creativity researcher at Goldsmiths, University of London. ‘It scares a <b>lot of people</b>. They are worried that it is taking <b>something special</b> away from what it means to be human.’","To <b>some extent</b>, we are <b>all familiar</b> with computerised art. The question is: where does the work of the artist stop and the creativity of the computer begin? Consider <b>one of the oldest</b> machine artists, Aaron, a robot that <b>has had</b> paintings exhibited in London’s Tate Modern and the <b>San Francisco</b> Museum of Modern Art. Aaron can <b>pick up</b> a paintbrush and paint on canvas on its own.<b> Impressive </b>perhaps, but it is still little more than a tool to realise the programmer’s own creative ideas.","Simon Colton, the designer of the <b>Painting Fool</b>, is keen to <b>make sure</b> his creation doesn’t attract the same criticism. Unlike earlier ‘artists’ such as Aaron, the <b>Painting Fool</b> only needs minimal direction and can <b>come up</b> with its own concepts by going online for material. The software runs its own web searches and trawls through <b>social media</b> sites. It is now beginning to display a kind of imagination too, creating pictures from scratch. One of its original works is a series of<b> fuzzy </b>landscapes, depicting trees and sky. <b>While some</b> might say they have a mechanical look, Colton argues that such reactions arise from people’s double standards towards software-produced and human-produced art. After all, he says, consider that the <b>Painting Fool</b> painted the landscapes without<b> referring </b>to a photo. ‘If a child painted a new<b> scene </b>from its head, you’d say it has a <b>certain level</b> of imagination,’ he points out. The same should be true of a machine.’ Software bugs can <b>also lead</b> to unexpected results. Some of the <b>Painting Fool</b>’s paintings of a chair came out in black and white, thanks to a technical glitch. This gives the work an eerie, ghostlike quality. Human artists like the<b> renowned </b>Ellsworth Kelly are lauded for limiting their colour palette – so why should computers be any different?","Researchers like Colton don’t believe it is right to measure machine creativity directly to that of humans who <b>have had</b><b> millennia </b>to develop our skills’. Others, though, are fascinated by the prospect that a computer might create something as original and subtle as our best artists So far, <b>only one</b> <b>has come</b> close.<b> Composer </b>David Cope invented a program called Experiments in Musical Intelligence, or EMI, Not only did EMI create<b> compositions </b>in Cope s style, but also that of the most revered classical composers, including Bach, Chopin and Mozart. Audiences were moved to tears, and EMI even fooled <b>classical music</b> experts into thinking they were hearing genuine Bach. Not everyone was impressed however. Some, such as Wiggins, have<b> blasted </b>Cope’s work as pseudoscience, and condemned him for his deliberately vague explanation of how the software worked. Meanwhile. Douglas Hofstadter of Indiana University said EMI created replicas which still rely completely on the original artist’s creative impulses, When audiences found out the truth they were often<b> outraged </b>with Cope, and one music lover even tried to<b> punch </b>him. Amid such controversy, Cope destroyed EMI’s vital databases.","But why did so <b>many people</b> love the music, yet recoil when they discovered how it was composed? A study by computer <b>scientist David</b> Moffat of Glasgow Caledonian University provides a clue. He asked both expert<b> musicians </b>and non-experts to assess six compositions. The participants weren’t told beforehand whether the<b> tunes </b>were composed by humans or computers, but were asked to guess, and then rate how much they liked <b>each one</b>. People who thought the<b> composer </b>was a computer tended to dislike the piece more than those who believed it was human. This was true even among the experts, who might <b>have been expected</b> to be more objective in their analyses.","Where does this prejudice come from? Paul Bloom of Yale <b>University has</b> a suggestion: he reckons part of the pleasure we get from art<b> stems </b>from the creative process behind the work. This can give it an ‘irresistible essence’, says Bloom. Meanwhile, experiments by Justin Kruger of <b>New York</b> University <b>have shown</b> that people s enjoyment of an artwork increases if they think more time and effort was needed to create it. Similarly, Colton thinks that when people experience art, they wonder what the artist might have been thinking or what the artist is trying to tell them. It seems obvious, therefore, that with computers producing art, this<b> speculation </b>is cut short – there’s nothing to explore. But as technology becomes increasingly complex, finding those <b>greater depths</b> in computer art could become possible. This is precisely why Colton asks the <b>Painting Fool</b> to tap into online<b> social </b>networks for its inspiration: hopefully this way it will choose themes that will already be meaningful to us."]},{"name":"ARE/13-2-1","paragraph":["<h2>Bringing cinnamon to Europe</h2>","Cinnamon is a sweet, fragrant<b> spice </b>produced from the inner bark of trees of the genus Cinnamomum, which is native to the Indian sub-continent. It was known in<b> biblical </b>times, and is mentioned in several books of the Bible, both as an ingredient that was mixed with oils for anointing people’s bodies, and also as a token indicating friendship among lovers and friends. In ancient Rome, mourners attending funerals burnt<b> cinnamon </b>to create a pleasant scent. Most often, however, the<b> spice </b>found its primary use as an additive to food and drink.","In the <b>Middle Ages</b>, Europeans who could afford the<b> spice </b>used it to flavor food, particularly meat, and to impress those around them with their ability to purchase an expensive condiment from the ‘exotic’ East. At a banquet, a<b> host </b>would offer guests a plate with various<b> spices </b>piled upon it as a sign of the wealth at his or her disposal.<b> Cinnamon </b>was also reported to have <b>health benefits</b>, and was thought to cure various ailments, such as indigestion.","Toward the end of the <b>Middle Ages</b>, the European <b>middle classes</b> began to desire the lifestyle of the elite, including their consumption of spices. This led to a growth in demand for<b> cinnamon </b>and other spices. At that time,<b> cinnamon </b>was transported by Arab merchants, who closely guarded the secret of the source of the<b> spice </b>from potential rivals. They took it from India, where it was grown, on camels via an overland route to the Mediterranean. Their journey ended when they reached Alexandria. European traders sailed there to purchase their supply of cinnamon, then brought it back to Venice.","The<b> spice </b>then travelled from that great trading city to markets all around Europe. Because the overland trade route allowed for only <b>small quantities</b> of the<b> spice </b>to reach Europe, and because Venice had a virtual<b> monopoly </b>of the trade, the Venetians could set the price of<b> cinnamon </b>exorbitantly high. These prices, coupled with the increasing demand, spurred the search for new routes to Asia by Europeans eager to <b>take part</b> in the<b> spice </b>trade.","Seeking the high profits promised by the<b> cinnamon </b>market, Portuguese traders arrived on the island of Ceylon in the <b>Indian Ocean</b> toward the end of the 15th century. Before <b>Europeans arrived</b> on the island, the state had organized the<b> cultivation </b>of cinnamon. People belonging to the ethnic <b>group called</b> the Salagama would peel the bark off young<b> shoots </b>of the<b> cinnamon </b>plant in the rainy season, when the wet bark was more pliable. During the peeling process, they<b> curled </b>the bark into the ‘stick’ shape still associated with the<b> spice </b>today.","The Salagama then gave the finished product to the king as a form of tribute. When the Portuguese arrived, they needed to increase production significantly, and so enslaved many <b>other members</b> of the Ceylonese native population, forcing them to work in<b> cinnamon </b>harvesting. In 1518, the Portuguese built a fort on Ceylon, which enabled them to protect the island, so helping them to develop a<b> monopoly </b>in the<b> cinnamon </b>trade and generate <b>very high</b> profits. In the late 16th century, for example, they enjoyed a tenfold profit when shipping<b> cinnamon </b>over a journey of eight days from Ceylon to India.","When the <b>Dutch arrived</b> off the coast of southern Asia at the very beginning of the 17th century, the set their sights on displacing the Portuguese as kings of cinnamon. The Dutch allied themselves with Kandy, an<b> inland </b>kingdom on Ceylon. In return for payments of elephants and cinnamon, they protected the native king from the Portuguese. By 1649, the Dutch broke the 150-year Portuguese<b> monopoly </b>when they<b> overran </b>and occupied their factories. By 1658, they had permanently expelled the Portuguese from the island, thereby gaining control of the lucrative<b> cinnamon </b>trade.","In <b>order to protect</b> their hold on the market, the Dutch, like the Portuguese before them, treated the native<b> inhabitants </b>harshly. Because of the need to boost production and satisfy Europe’s ever-increasing appetite for cinnamon, the Dutch began to alter the harvesting practices of the Ceylonese. Over time, the supply of<b> cinnamon </b>trees on the island <b>became nearly</b> exhausted, due to systematic<b> stripping </b>of the bark. Eventually, the Dutch began<b> cultivating </b>their own<b> cinnamon </b>trees to supplement the<b> diminishing </b>number of wild trees available for use.","Then, in 1996, the English arrived on Ceylon, thereby displacing the Dutch from their control of the<b> cinnamon </b>monopoly. By the middle of the 19th century, production of<b> cinnamon </b>reached 1,000 tons a year, after a lower grade quality of the<b> spice </b>became acceptable to European tastes. By that time,<b> cinnamon </b>was being grown in <b>other parts</b> of the <b>Indian Ocean</b> region and in the West Indies, Brazil, and Guyana. Not only was a<b> monopoly </b>of<b> cinnamon </b>becoming impossible, but the<b> spice </b>trade overall was<b> diminishing </b>in economic potential, and was eventually<b> superseded </b>by the rise of trade in coffee, tea, chocolate, and sugar."]},{"name":"ARE/13-2-2","paragraph":["<h2>Oxytocin</h2>","The positive and negative effects of the chemical known as the ‘love hormone’","<b>A</b>","Oxytocin is a chemical, a<b> hormone </b>produced in the pituitary gland in the brain. It was through <b>various studies</b> focusing on animals that scientists first became aware of the influence of oxytocin. They discovered that it helps reinforce the bonds between prairie voles, which mate for life, and triggers the motherly behaviour that sheep show towards their newborn lambs. It is also released by women in childbirth, strengthening the attachment between mother and baby. Few chemicals have as positive a reputation as oxytocin, which is sometimes<b> referred </b>to as the ‘love hormone’. One<b> sniff </b>of it can, it is claimed, make a person more trusting, empathetic, generous and cooperative. It is time, however, to revise this wholly<b> optimistic </b>view. A new wave of studies <b>has shown</b> that its effects vary greatly depending on the person and the circumstances, and it can impact on our<b> social </b>interactions for worse as well as for better.","<b>B</b>","Oxytocin’s role in human behaviour first emerged in 2005. In a groundbreaking experiments, Markus Heinrichs and his colleagues at the University of Freiburg, Germany, <b>asked volunteers</b> to do an activity in which they could invest money with an anonymous person who was not<b> guaranteed </b>to be honest. The <b>team found</b> the participants who had sniffed<b> oxytocin </b>via a nasal spray beforehand invested more money than those who received a placebo instead. The study was the start of research into the effects of<b> oxytocin </b>on human interactions. ‘For eight years, it was quite a lonesome field,’ Heinrichs recalls. ‘Now, everyone is interested.’ These follow-up <b><b>studies have</b> shown</b> that after a<b> sniff </b>of the hormone, people become more charitable, better at reading emotions on others’ faces and at communicating constructively in arguments. Together, the results<b> fuelled </b>the view that<b> oxytocin </b>universally enhanced the positive aspects of our<b> social </b>nature.","<b>C</b>","Then, after a <b>few years</b>, contrasting findings began to emerge. Simone Shamay-Tsoory at the at the University of Haifa, Israel, found that when volunteers played a competitive game, those who inhaled the<b> hormone </b>showed more pleasure when they beat other players, and felt more envy when others won. What’s more, administering<b> oxytocin </b><b>also has</b> sharply contrasting outcomes depending on a person’s disposition. Jennifer Bartz from Mount Sinai School of Medicine, <b>New York</b>, found that it improves people’s ability to read emotions, but only if they are not very<b> socially </b>adept to begin with. Her <b><b>research also</b> shows</b> that<b> oxytocin </b>in fact reduces cooperation in subjects who are particularly anxious or sensitive to rejection.","<b>D</b>","Another discovery is that oxytocin’s effects vary depending on who we are interacting with. Studies conducted by Carolyn DeClerck of the University of Antwerp, Belgium, revealed that people who had received a dose of<b> oxytocin </b>actually became less<b> cooperative </b>when dealing with complete strangers. Meanwhile, Carsten De Dreu at the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands discovered that volunteers given<b> oxytocin </b>showed favouritism: Dutch men became quicker to associate positive words with Dutch names than with foreign ones, for example. According to De Dreu,<b> oxytocin </b>drives people to care for those in their<b> social </b>circles and defend them from outside dangers. So, it appears that<b> oxytocin </b>strengthens biases, rather than promoting general goodwill, as was <b>previously thought</b>.","<b>E</b>","There were signs of these subtleties from the start. Bartz <b>has recently</b> shown that in almost half of the existing research results,<b> oxytocin </b>influenced only certain individuals or in certain circumstances. Where once researchers took no notice of such findings, now a more<b> nuanced </b>understanding of oxytocin’s effects is propelling investigations down new lines. To Bartz, the key to understanding what the<b> hormone </b>does lies in pinpointing its core function rather than in<b> cataloguing </b>its seemingly endless effects. There are several<b> hypotheses </b>which are not mutually exclusive.<b> Oxytocin </b>could <b>help to reduce</b> anxiety and fear. Or it could simply motivate people to seek out<b> social </b>connections. She believes that<b> oxytocin </b>acts as a chemical<b> spotlight </b>that shines on<b> social </b>clues – a shift in posture, a flicker of the eyes, a dip in the voice – <b>making people</b> more attuned to their<b> social </b>environment. This would explain why it makes us more likely to look others in the eye and improves our ability to identify emotions. But it could <b>also make</b> things worse for people who are overly sensitive or prone to<b> interpreting </b>social<b> cues </b>in the worst light.","<b>F</b>","Perhaps we should not be surprised that the<b> oxytocin </b>story <b>has become</b> more perplexing. The<b> hormone </b>is found in everything from octopuses to sheep, and its evolutionary roots stretch back half a billion years. ‘It’s a <b>very simple</b> and ancient<b> molecule </b>that has been co-opted for <b>many different</b> functions,’ says Sue Carter at the University of Illinois, Chicago, USA. ‘It affects<b> primitive </b>parts of the brain like the amygdala, so it’s going to have many effects on just about everything.’ Bartz agrees. ‘Oxytocin probably does <b>some very</b> basic things, but once you add our higher-order thinking and<b> social </b>situations, these basic processes could manifest in <b>different ways</b> depending on individual differences and context.’"]},{"name":"ARE/13-2-3","paragraph":["<h2>Making the most of trends</h2>","Experts from Harvard <b>Business School</b> give advice to managers","Most managers can identify the major trends of the day. But it the course of conducting research in a number of industries and working directly with companies, we <b>have discovered</b> that managers often fail to recognize the <b>less obvious</b> but profound ways these trends are influencing consumers’ aspirations, attitudes, and behaviors. This is especially true of trends that managers view as<b> peripheral </b>to their core markets.","Many ignore trends in their innovation strategies or adopt a wait-and-see approach and let competitors <b>take the lead</b>. At a minimum, such responses mean missed profit opportunities. At the extreme, they can jeopardize a company by ceding to<b> rivals </b>the opportunity to transform the industry. The purpose of this article is twofold: to spur managers to think more expansively about how trends could engender new <b>value proposition</b>s in their core markets, and to <b>provide some</b> high-level advice on how to make market research and product development<b> personnel </b>more adept at analyzing and<b> exploiting </b>trends.","One strategy, known as ‘infuse and augment’, is to design a <b>product or service</b> that retains most of the attributes and functions of <b>existing products</b> in the category but adds others that address the needs and desires unleashed by a major trend. A case in point in the Poppy range of handbags, which the firm Coach created in response to the economic downturn of 2008. The Coach brand had been a symbol of opulence and luxury for nearly 70 years, and the most obvious reaction to the downturn would have been to lower prices. However, that would have risked cheapening the brand’s image. Instead, they initiated a consumer-<b>research project</b> which revealed that customers were eager to lift themselves and the country out of tough times. Using these insights, Coach launched the lower-priced Poppy handbags, which were in vibrant colors, and looked more youthful and playful than conventional Coach products. Creating the sub-brand allowed Coach to avert an across-the-board price cut. In contrast to the many companies that responded to the<b> recession </b>by cutting prices, Coach saw the new consumer mindset as an opportunity for innovation and renewal.","<b>A </b> further example of this strategy was supermarket Tesco’s response to consumers’ growing <b>concerns about the environment</b>. With that in mind, Tesco, one of the world’s top five retailers, introduced its Greener Living program, which demonstrates the company’s commitment to protecting the environment by involving consumers in ways that produce tangible results. For example, Tesco customers can accumulate points for such activities as reusing bags,<b> recycling </b>cans and printer cartridges, and buying home-insulation materials. Like points earned on regular purchases, these green points can be redeemed for cash. Tesco <b>has no</b>t abandoned its traditional retail offering but augmented its business with these innovations, thereby infusing its <b>value proposition</b> with a green streak.","<b>A </b> more<b> radical </b>strategy is ‘combine and transcend’. This<b> entails </b>combining aspects of the product’s existing <b>value proposition</b> with attributes addressing changes arising from a trend, to create a novel experience – one that may land the company in an entirely new market space. At first glance, spending resources to<b> incorporate </b>elements of a seemingly<b> irrelevant </b>trend into one’s core offerings <b>sounds like</b> it’s hardly worthwhile. But consider Nike’s move to integrate the digital revolution into its reputation for high-performance<b> athletic </b>footwear. In 2006, they teamed <b>up with technology</b> company Apple to launch Nike+, a digital sports kit comprising a sensor that attaches to the running shoe and a wireless receiver that connects to the user’s iPod. By combining Nike’s original <b>value proposition</b> for amateur athletes with one for digital consumers, the Nike+ sports kit and web interface moved the company from a focus on<b> athletic </b>apparel to a new plane of engagement with its customers.","<b>A </b> third approach, known as ‘counteract and reaffirm’, involves developing <b>products or services</b> that stress the values traditionally associated with the category in ways that allow consumers to oppose – or at least<b> temporarily </b>escape from – the aspects of trends they view as undesirable. A product that accomplished this is the ME2, a video game created by Canada’s iToys. By reaffirming the toy category’s association with physical play, the ME2 counteracted some of the widely perceived negative impacts of digital gaming devices. <b>Like other</b> handheld games, the device featured a<b> host </b>of exciting interactive games, a full-color LCD screen, and advanced 3D graphics. What set it apart was that it<b> incorporated </b>the traditional physical component of children’s play: it contained a pedometer, which tracked and awarded points for <b>physical activity</b> (walking, running, biking, skateboarding, climbing stairs). The child could use the points to enhance various virtual skills needed for the video game. The ME2, introduced in mid-2008,<b> catered </b>to kids’ huge desire to play video games while countering the negatives, such as associations with lack of exercise and obesity.","<b>Once you have</b> gained<b> perspective </b>on how trend-related changes in consumer opinions and behaviors impact on your category, you can determine which of our three innovation strategies to pursue. When your category’s basic <b>value proposition</b> continues to be meaningful for consumers influenced by the trend, the infuse-and-augment strategy will allow you to reinvigorate the category. If analysis reveals an increasing disparity between your category and consumers’ new focus, your innovations need to transcend the category to integrate the two worlds. Finally, if aspects of the category clash with undesired outcomes of a trend, such as associations with unhealthy lifestyles, there is an opportunity to counteract those changes by reaffirming the core values of your category.","Trends – technological, economic, environmental, social, or political – that affect how people perceive the world around them and shape what they expect from <b>products and services</b> present firms with unique<b> opportunities </b>for growth."]},{"name":"ARE/13-3-1","paragraph":["<h2>The coconut palm</h2>","For millennia, the coconut has been central to the lives of Polynesian and Asian peoples. In the western world, on the other hand, coconuts <b>have always</b> been<b> exotic </b>and unusual, sometimes rare. The Italian merchant traveller Marco Polo apparently saw coconuts in South Asia in the late 13th century, and among the mid-14th-century travel writings of Sir John Mandeville there is mention of ‘great Notes of Ynde’ (great Nuts of India). Today, images of palm-fringed tropical beaches are clichés in the west to sell holidays, chocolate bars, fizzy drinks and even romance.","Typically, we envisage coconuts as brown cannonballs that, when opened, provide sweet white flesh. But we see only part of the fruit and none of the plant from which they come. The coconut palm has a smooth, slender, grey trunk, up to 30 metres tall. This is an <b>important source</b> of<b> timber </b>for building houses, and is increasingly being used as a replacement for endangered hardwoods in the furniture construction industry. The trunk is surmounted by a rosette of leaves, each of which may be up to six metres long. The leaves have hard veins in their centres which, in <b>many <b>parts of the world</b></b>, are used as brushes after the green part of the leaf has been<b> stripped </b>away. Immature coconut flowers are tightly clustered together among the leaves at the top of the trunk. The flower<b> stems </b>may be tapped for their<b> sap </b>to produce a drink, and the<b> sap </b>can also be reduced by boiling to produce a type of sugar used for cooking.","Coconut palms produce as many as seventy fruits <b>per year</b>, weighing more than a kilogram each. The wall of the fruit has three layers: a<b> waterproof </b>outer layer, a<b> fibrous </b>middle layer and a hard, inner layer. The thick<b> fibrous </b>middle layer produces coconut fibre, ‘coir’, which <b>has numerous</b> uses and is <b>particularly important</b> in manufacturing ropes. The woody innermost layer, the shell, with its three prominent ‘eyes’, surrounds the seed. An important product obtained from the shell is charcoal, which is <b>widely used</b> in various industries as well as in the home as a cooking fuel. When broken in half, the shells are <b><b>also use</b>d</b> as bowls in <b>many parts</b> of Asia.","Inside the shell are the nutrients (endosperm) needed by the developing seed. Initially, the<b> endosperm </b>is a sweetish liquid, coconut water, which is enjoyed as a drink, but <b>also provide</b>s the<b> hormones </b>which encourage <b>other plants</b> to grow more rapidly and <b>produce higher</b> yields. As the fruit matures, the coconut water gradually<b> solidifies </b>to form the brilliant white, fat-rich, edible<b> flesh </b>or meat.<b> Dried </b>coconut flesh, ‘copra’, is made into coconut oil and coconut milk, which are <b>widely used</b> in cooking in <b>different <b>parts of the world</b></b>, as well as in cosmetics. A derivative of coconut fat, glycerine, acquired strategic importance in a <b>quite different</b> sphere, as Alfred Nobel introduced the world to his nitroglycerine-based invention: dynamite.","Their biology would appear to make coconuts the great maritime voyagers and coastal colonizers of the plant world. The large, energy-rich fruits are able to float in water and tolerate salt, but cannot remain viable indefinitely; <b>studies suggest</b> after about 110 days at sea they are <b>no longer</b> able to germinate. Literally cast onto<b> desert </b>island shores, with little more than sand to grow in and exposed to the full glare of the tropical sun, coconut seeds are able to<b> germinate </b>and root. The air pocket in the seed, created as the<b> endosperm </b>solidifies, protects the embryo. In addition, the<b> fibrous </b>fruit wall that helped it to float during the<b> voyage </b>stores<b> moisture </b>that can be <b>taken up</b> by the roots of the coconut<b> seedling </b>as it starts to grow.","There have been centuries of academic debate over the origins of the coconut. There were no coconut palms in West Africa, the Caribbean or the <b>east coast</b> of the Americans before the<b> voyages </b>of the European<b> explorers </b>Vasco da Gama and Columbus in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. 16th century trade and human migration patterns reveal that Arab traders and European sailors are <b>likely to have</b> moved coconuts from South and <b>Southeast Asia</b> to Africa and then across the Atlantic to the <b>east coast</b> of America. But the origin of coconuts discovered along the west coast of America by 16th century sailors has been the subject of centuries of discussion. Two<b> diametrically </b>opposed origins have been proposed: that they came from Asia, or that they were native to America. Both suggestions <b>have problems</b>. In Asia, there is a large degree of coconut diversity and evidence of<b> millennia </b>of human use – but there are no relatives growing in the wild.

So how does the sweet if sometimes absurd sound of infant-directed speech influence a baby’s development? <b>Here are some</b> <b>recent studies</b> that explore the science behind <b>baby talk</b>.","<b>C</b>","Fathers don’t <b>use <b>baby talk</b></b> as often or in the same ways as mothers – and that’s perfectly OK, according to a new study. Mark VanDam of Washington <b>State University</b> at Spokane and colleagues equipped parents with recording devices and speech-recognition software to study the way they interacted with their<b> youngsters </b>during a normal day. ‘We found that moms do exactly what you’d expect and what’s been described m<b>any time</b>s over,’ VanDam explains. ‘But we found that dads aren’t doing the <b>same thing</b>.

It suggests that fathers use less familial language to provide their children with a bridge to the <b>kind of speech</b> they’ll hear in public. ‘The idea is that a kid gets to practice a certain <b>kind of speech</b> with mom and another <b>kind of speech</b> with dad, so the kid then has a wider<b> repertoire </b>of kinds of speech to practice,’ says VanDam.","<b>D</b>","Scientists from the University of Washington and the University of Connecticut collected thousands of 30-second conversations between parents and their babies, fitting 26 children with audio-recording vests that captured language and sound during a typical eight-hour day. The <b>study found</b> that the more <b>baby talk</b> parents used, the more their<b> youngsters </b>began to babble. And when researchers saw the same babies at age two, they found that frequent <b>baby talk</b> had dramatically boosted vocabulary, regardless of <b>socioeconomic status</b>. ‘Those children who listened to a lot of <b>baby talk</b> were talking more than the babies that listened to more adult talk or standard speech,’ says Nairán Ramirez-Esparza of the University of Connecticut. ‘We <b>also found</b> that it <b>really matters</b> whether you <b>use <b>baby talk</b></b> in a one-on-one context,’ she adds. ‘The more parents <b>use <b>baby talk</b></b> one-on-one, the more babies babble, and the more they babble, the more words they produce later in life.’","<b>E</b>","<b>Another study</b> suggests that parents might want to pair their<b> youngsters </b>up so they can<b> babble </b>more with their own kind. Researchers from McGill University and Université du Québec à Montréal found that babies seem to like listening to <b>each other</b> rather than to adults – which may be why <b>baby talk</b> is such a universal tool among parents. They played repeating vowel sounds made by a special synthesizing device that mimicked sounds made by either an adult woman or another baby. This way, only the impact of the<b> auditory </b>cues was observed. The team then measured how long each type of sound held the infants’ attention. They found that the ‘infant’ sounds held babies’ attention nearly 40 percent longer. The baby noises also<b> induced </b>more reactions in the listening infants, like smiling or lip moving, which approximates sound making. The team theorizes that this attraction to other infant sounds could help launch the learning process that leads to speech. ‘It may be some property of the sound that is just drawing their attention,’ says study co-author Linda Polka. ‘Or maybe they are really interested in that <b>particular type</b> of sound because they are starting to focus on their own ability to make sounds. We are<b> speculating </b>here but it might catch their attention because they recognize it as a sound they could possibly make.’","<b>F</b>","In a study published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a total of 57 babies from two <b>slightly different</b> <b>age groups</b> – seven months and eleven and a half months – were played a number of syllables from both their native language (English) and a non-native tongue (Spanish). The infants were placed in a brain-activation scanner that recorded activity in a brain region known to guide the motor movements that produce speech. The <b>results suggest</b> that listening to <b>baby talk</b> prompts infant brains to start practicing their language skills. ‘Finding activation in motor areas the baby brain is engaged in trying to talk back right from the start, and suggests that seven-month-olds’ brains are already trying to figure out how to make interesting finding was that while the seven-month-olds responded to all speech sounds regardless of language, the brains of the older infants worked harder at the motor activations of non-native sounds compared to native sounds. The study may <b>have also</b> uncovered a process by which babies recognize differences between their native language and other tongues."]},{"name":"ARE/13-3-3","paragraph":["<h2>Whatever happened to the Harappan Civilisation?</h2>","<b>New research</b><b> sheds </b>light on the disappearance of an ancient society","<b>A</b>","The <b>Harappan Civilisation</b> of ancient Pakistan and India flourished 5,000 <b>years ago</b>, but a <b>thousand years</b> later their cities were abandoned. The <b>Harappan Civilisation</b> was a<b> sophisticated </b><b>Bronze Age</b> society who built ‘megacities’ and traded internationally in luxury<b> craft </b>products, and yet seemed to <b>have left</b> almost no depictions of themselves. But their lack of self-imagery – at a time when the Egyptians were carving and painting<b> representations </b>of themselves all over their temples – is only part of the mystery.","<b>B</b>","‘There is plenty of archaeological evidence to tell us about the rise of the <b>Harappan Civilisation</b>, but relatively little about its fall,’ explains archaeologist Dr Cameron Petrie of the <b>University of Cambridge</b>. ‘As populations increased, cities were built that had great baths,<b> craft </b>workshops, palaces and halls<b> laid </b>out in distinct sectors. Houses were arranged in blocks, with wide main streets and narrow alleyways, and many had their own wells and<b> drainage </b>systems. It was <b>very much</b> a “thriving” civilisation.’ Then around 2100 BC, a transformation began. Streets went uncleaned, buildings started to be abandoned, and<b> ritual </b>structures <b>fell out of use</b>. After their final demise, a<b> millennium </b>passed before really large-scale cities appeared once more in South Asia.","<b>C</b>","<b>Some have</b> claimed that major glacier-fed rivers changed their course, dramatically affecting the <b>water supply</b> and agriculture; or that the cities could not cope with an increasing population, they exhausted their<b> resource </b>base, the trading economy <b>broke down</b> or they succumbed to invasion and conflict; and yet others that <b>climate change</b> caused an <b>environmental change</b> that affected <b>food and water</b> provision. ‘It is unlikely that there was a single cause for the decline of the civilisation. But the fact is, until now, we have <b>had little</b> solid evidence from the area for most of the key elements,’ said Petrie. ‘A lot of the archaeological debate has really only been well-argued speculation.’","<b>D</b>","<b>A </b> research <b>team led</b> by Petrie, together with Dr Ravindanath Singh of Banaras Hindu University in India, found early in their investigations that many of the archaeological sites were not where they were supposed to be, completely altering understanding of the way that this region was<b> inhabited </b>in the past. When they <b>carried out a survey</b> of how the larger area was settled in relation to sources of water, they found inaccuracies in the published geographic locations of ancient settlements ranging from several hundred metres to many kilometres. They realised that any attempts to use the existing data were likely to be fundamentally flawed. Over the course of several seasons of<b> fieldwork </b>they carried out new surveys, finding an astonishing 198 settlement sites that were previously unknown.","<b>E</b>","Now, research published by Dr Yama Dixit and Professor David Hodell, both from Cambridge’s Department of Earth Sciences, has provided the first<b> definitive </b>evidence for <b>climate change</b> affecting the plains of north-western India, where hundreds of Harappan sites are known to have been situated. The researchers gathered shells of Melanoides tuberculate snails from the<b> sediments </b>of an ancient lake and used geochemical analysis as a means of tracing the climate history of the region. ‘As today, the <b>major source</b> of water into the lake is <b>likely to have</b> been the summer monsoon,’ says Dixit. ‘But we have observed that there was an abrupt change about 4,100 <b>years ago</b>, when the amount of<b> evaporation </b>from the lake exceeded the<b> rainfall </b>– indicative of a drought.’ Hodell adds: ‘We<b> estimate </b>that the weakening of the Indian summer<b> monsoon </b>climate lasted about 200 years before recovering to the previous conditions, which we <b>still see</b> today.’","<b>F</b>","It <b>has long</b> been thought that other great <b>Bronze Age</b> civilisations also declined at a similar time, with a global-scale climate event being seen as the cause. While it is possible that these local-scale processes were linked, the real archaeological interest lies in understanding the impact of these larger-scale events on different environments and different populations. ‘Considering the vast area of the <b>Harappan Civilisation</b> with its variable weather systems,’ explains Singh, ‘it is essential that we obtain more climate data from areas close to the two great cities at Mohenjodaro and Harappa and also from the Indian Punjab.’","<b>G</b>","Petrie and Singh’s <b>team is now</b> examining archaeological records and trying to understand details of how people led their lives in the region five<b> millennia </b>ago. They are analysing grains cultivated at the time, and trying to work out whether they were grown under <b>extreme conditions</b> of water stress, and whether they were adjusting the combinations of crops they were growing for <b>different weather</b> systems. They are also looking at whether the types of pottery used, and other aspects of their material culture, were distinctive to specific regions or were more similar across larger areas. This <b>gives us insight</b> into the types of interactive networks that the population was involved in, and whether those changed.","<b>H</b>","Petrie believes that archaeologists are in a unique position to investigate how past<b> societies </b>responded to environmental and climatic change. ‘By investigating responses to environmental pressures and threats, we can learn from the past to engage with the public, and the<b> relevant </b>governmental and administrative bodies, to be more<b> proactive </b>in <b>issues such</b> as the management and administration of <b>water supply</b>, the balance of <b>urban and rural</b> development, and the importance of<b> preserving </b>cultural<b> heritage </b>in the future.’"]},{"name":"ARE/13-4-1","paragraph":["<h2>Cutty Sark: the fastest sailing ship of all time</h2>","The <b>nineteenth century</b> was a period of great technological development in Britain, and for shipping the major changes were from wind to steam power, and from wood to iron and steel.","The fastest commercial sailing<b> vessels </b>of <b>all time</b> were clippers, three-masted ships built to transport goods a<b>round the world</b>, <b>although some</b> also took passengers. From the 1840s until 1869, when the Suez Canal opened and steam propulsion was replacing sail, clippers<b> dominated </b>world trade. <b>Although many</b> were built, <b>only one</b> has survived more or less intact: <b>Cutty Sark</b>, now on display in Greenwich, southeast London.","<b>Cutty Sark</b>’s<b> unusual </b>name comes from the poem Tam O’Shanter by the Scottish poet Robert Burns. Tam, a farmer, is chased by a<b> witch </b>called Nannie, who is wearing a ‘<b>cutty sark</b>’ – an old Scottish name for a short nightdress. The<b> witch </b>is depicted in <b>Cutty Sark</b>’s figurehead – the carving of a woman typically at the front of <b>old sailing</b> ships. In legend, and in Burns’s poem,<b> witches </b>cannot cross water, so this was a <b>rather strange</b> choice of name for a ship.","<b>Cutty Sark</b> was built in Dumbarton, Scotland, in 1869, for a shipping company owned by John Willis. To carry out construction, Willis chose a new<b> shipbuilding </b>firm, Scott & Linton, and ensured that the contrast with them put him in a very strong position. In the end, the firm was forced out of business, and the<b> ship </b>was finished by a competitor.","Willis’s company was active in the tea trade between China and Britain, where speed could bring shipowners both profits and prestige, so <b>Cutty Sark</b> was designed to make the journey more quickly than <b>any other</b> ship. On her maiden voyage, in 1870, she set sail from London, carrying <b><b>large amount</b>s</b> of goods to China. She returned laden with tea, making the journey back to London in <b>four months</b>. However, <b>Cutty Sark</b> never lived up to the high expectations of her owner, as a result of bad winds and various misfortunes. On one occasion, in 1872, the<b> ship </b>and a<b> rival </b>clipper, Thermopylae, left port in China on the same day. Crossing the <b>Indian Ocean</b>, <b>Cutty Sark</b> gained a lead of over 400 miles, but then her<b> rudder </b>was<b> severely </b>damaged in stormy seas, making her impossible to steer. The ship’s crew had the<b> daunting </b>task of repairing the<b> rudder </b>at sea, and only succeeded at the <b>second attempt</b>. <b>Cutty Sark</b> reached London a week after Thermopylae.","<b>Steam ships</b> posed a growing threat to clippers, as their speed and cargo capacity increased. In addition, the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, the same year that <b>Cutty Sark</b> was launched, had a serious impact. While <b>steam ships</b> could <b>make use</b> of the quick, direct route between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, the canal was of no use to sailing ships, which needed the much stronger winds of the oceans, and so had to sail a far greater distance. <b>Steam ships</b> reduced the journey time between Britain and China by approximately <b>two months</b>.","By 1878, tea traders weren’t interested in <b>Cutty Sark</b>, and instead, she took on the <b>much less</b><b> prestigious </b>work of carrying any cargo between any two ports in the world. In 1880, violence aboard the<b> ship </b>led ultimately to the replacement of the captain with an incompetent drunkard who stole the crew’s wages. He was suspended from service, and a new captain appointed. This marked a turnaround and the beginning of the most successful period in <b>Cutty Sark</b>’s working life, transporting<b> wool </b>from Australia to Britain. <b>One such</b> journey took just under 12 weeks, beating <b>every other</b><b> ship </b>sailing that year by around a month.","The ship’s next captain, Richard Woodget, was an<b> excellent </b>navigator, who got the best out of both his<b> ship </b>and his crew. As a sailing ship, <b>Cutty Sark</b> depended on the strong <b>trade winds</b> of the southern hemisphere, and Wood<b>get too</b>k her further south than <b>any previous</b> captain, bringing her dangerously close to icebergs off the southern tip of <b>South America</b>. His gamble paid off, though, and the<b> ship </b>was the fastest<b> vessel </b>in the<b> wool </b>trade for <b>ten years</b>.","As competition from <b>steam ships</b> increased in the 1890s, and <b>Cutty Sark</b> approached the end of her <b>life expectancy</b>, she became less profitable. She was sold to a Portuguese firm, which renamed her Ferreira. For the next 25 years, she again carried miscellaneous cargoes a<b>round the world</b>.","Badly damaged in a gale in 1922, she was put into Falmouth harbor in southwest England, for repairs. Wilfred Dowman, a retired sea captain who owned a training vessel, recognised her and tried to buy her, but without success. She returned to Portugal and was sold to another Portuguese company. Dowman was determined, however, and offered a high price: this was accepted, and the<b> ship </b>returned to Falmouth the following year and had her original name restored.","Dowman used <b>Cutty Sark</b> as a training ship, and she continued in this role after his death.

At the <b>same time</b>, our understanding of its importance to humans <b>has grown</b>. A single gram of healthy soil might contain 100 million bacteria, as well as other<b> microorganisms </b>such as viruses and fungi, living amid decomposing plants and various minerals.","That means soils do not just grow our food, but are the source of <b>nearly all</b> our existing antibiotics, and could be our best hope in the fight against antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Soil is also an ally against <b>climate change</b>: as<b> microorganisms </b>within soil digest dead animals and plants, they lock in their carbon content, holding <b>three times</b> the <b>amount of carbon</b> as does the entire atmosphere. Soils also store water, preventing flood damage: in the UK, damage to buildings, roads and bridges from floods caused by soil<b> degradation </b>costs £233 million <b>every year</b>.","<b>C</b>","If the soil loses its ability to perform these functions, the human race could be in big trouble. The danger is not that the soil will disappear completely, but that the<b> microorganisms </b>that give it its special properties will be lost. And once this has happened, it may take the soil <b>thousands of years</b> to recover.","Agriculture is by far the biggest problem. In the wild, when <b>plants grow</b> they remove nutrients from the soil, but then when the plants die and decay these nutrients are returned directly to the soil. Humans tend not to return unused parts of harvested crops directly to the soil to enrich it, meaning that the soil gradually becomes less fertile. In the past we developed strategies to get around the problem, such as regularly varying the types of crops grown, or leaving fields<b> uncultivated </b>for a season.","<b>D</b>","But these practices became inconvenient as populations grew and agriculture had to be run on more commercial lines. A solution came in the early 20th century with the Haber-Bosch process for manufacturing ammonium nitrate. Farmers have been putting this synthetic<b> fertiliser </b>on their fields <b>ever since</b>.","But over the past <b>few decades</b>, it <b>has become</b> clear this wasn’t such a bright idea.

He came to realise that the <b>best way</b> to ensure his trees flourished was to <b>take care</b> of the soil, and <b>has developed</b> a cocktail of beneficial bacteria,<b> fungi </b>and humus* to do this.

When they applied Floris’s mix to the desert-like test plots, a good crop of plants emerged that were not just healthy at the surface, but had roots <b>strong enough</b> to pierce dirt as hard as rock. The few plants that grew in the control plots, fed with traditional fertilisers, were small and weak","<b>F</b>","However, measures like this are not enough to solve the global soil<b> degradation </b>problem. To assess our options on a global scale we <b>first need</b> an accurate picture of what types of soil are out there, and the problems they face. That’s not easy. For <b>one thing</b>, there is no agreed international system for classifying soil. In an attempt to unify the <b>different approaches</b>, the UN has created the Global Soil Map project.

If we are asked why happiness matters we can give no further<b> external </b>reason. It just obviously <b>does matter</b>.’ This pronouncement by Richard Layard, an economist and advocate of ‘positive psychology’, summarises the beliefs of <b>many <b>people today</b></b>. For Layard and others <b>like him</b>, it is obvious that the purpose of government is to promote a state of collective well-being. The only question is how to achieve it, and here positive<b> psychology </b>– a supposed science that not only identifies what <b>makes people</b> happy but also allows their happiness to be measured – can show the way. Equipped with this science, they say, governments can secure happiness in society in a way they never could in the past.","It is an astonishingly<b> crude </b>and simple-minded way of thinking, and for that very reason increasingly popular. Those who think in this way are oblivious to the vast philosophical literature in which the meaning and value of happiness have been explored and questioned, and write as if nothing of <b>any importance</b> had been thought on the subject until it came to their attention. It was the<b> philosopher </b>Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832) who was more than anyone else<b> responsible </b>for the development of this way of thinking. For Bentham it was obvious that the human good consists of pleasure and the absence of pain. The Greek<b> philosopher </b>Aristotle may <b>have identified</b> happiness with self-realisation in the 4th century BC, and thinkers throughout the ages may have struggled to reconcile the pursuit of happiness with other human values, but for Bentham all this was mere metaphysics or fiction. Without knowing anything much of him or the school of moral theory he established – since they are by education and intellectual<b> conviction </b>illiterate in the history of ideas – our advocates of positive<b> psychology </b>follow in his tracks in rejecting as outmoded and<b> irrelevant </b>pretty much the entirety of<b> ethical </b>reflection on human happiness to date.","But as William Davies notes in his recent book The Happiness Industry, the view that happiness is the only self-evident good is actually a way of limiting moral inquiry. One of the virtues of this rich, lucid and arresting book is that it places the current<b> cult </b>of happiness in a well-defined historical framework. Rightly, Davies his story with Bentham, noting that he was far more than a philosopher. Davies writes, ‘Bentham’s activities were those which we might now associate with a public sector management consultant’. In the 1790s, he wrote to the Home Office suggesting that the departments of government be linked together through a set of ‘conversation tubes’, and to the Bank of England with a design for a printing device that could produce unforgeable banknotes. He<b> drew </b>up plans for a ‘frigidarium’ to keep<b> provisions </b>such as meat, fish, <b>fruit and vegetables</b> fresh. His celebrated design for a prison to be known as a ‘Panopticon’, in which prisoners would be kept in<b> solitary </b>confinement while being visible at <b><b>all time</b>s</b> to the guards, was very nearly adopted. (Surprisingly, Davies does not discuss the fact that Bentham meant his Panopticon not just as a model prison but also as an instrument of control that could be applied to schools and factories.)","Bentham was also a pioneer of the ‘science of happiness’. If happiness is to be regarded as a science, it has to be measured, and Bentham suggested two ways in which this might be done. Viewing happiness as a complex of pleasurable sensations, he suggested that it might be quantified by measuring the human pulse rate. Alternatively, money could be used as the standard for quantification: if <b>two different</b> goods <b>have the same</b> price, it can be claimed that they produce the same quantity of pleasure in the consumer. Bentham was more attracted by the<b> latter </b>measure. By associating money so closely to inner experience, Davies writes, Bentham ‘set the stage for the entangling of<b> psychological </b>research and<b> capitalism </b>that would shape the business practices of the <b>twentieth century</b>’.","The Happiness Industry describes how the project of a science of happiness <b>has become</b> integral to capitalism. We learn much that is interesting about how economic problems are being redefined and treated as<b> psychological </b>maladies. In addition, Davies shows how the belief that inner of pleasure and displeasure can be objectively measured has informed management studies and advertising. The<b> tendency </b>of thinkers such as J B Watson, the founder of behaviourism*, was that <b>human beings</b> could be shaped, or manipulated, by policymakers and managers. Watson <b>had no</b><b> factual </b>basis for his view of human action. When he became president of the American<b> Psychological </b>Association in 1915, he ‘<b>had never</b> even studied a single human being’: his research had been confined to experiments on white rats. Yet Watson’s reductive model is now widely applied, with ‘behaviour change’ becoming the goal of governments: in Britain, a ‘Behaviour Insights Team’ has been established by the government to study how people can be encouraged, at minimum cost to the public purse, to live in what are considered to be<b> socially </b>desirable ways.","Modern<b> industrial </b>societies appear to need the possibility of ever-increasing happiness to motivate them in their labours. But whatever its intellectual pedigree, the idea that governments should be<b> responsible </b>for promoting happiness is always a threat to human freedom."]},{"name":"ARE/14-1-1","paragraph":["<h2>THE IMPORTANCE OF CHILDREN’S PLAY</h2>","Brick by brick, six-year-old Alice is building a magical kingdom.

But what they often lack is the evidence to base policies on.","‘The type of play we are interested in is child-initiated,<b> spontaneous </b>and unpredictable – but, as soon as you ask a five-year-old “to play”, then you as the researcher have intervened,’ explains Dr Sara Baker. ‘And we <b>want to know</b> what the long-term impact of play is.

In my previous research, I investigated how observing children at play can give us important clues about their well-being and can even be useful in the diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders like autism.’","Whitebread’s <b>recent research</b> has involved developing a play-based approach to supporting children’s writing. ‘Many <b>primary school</b> children find writing difficult, but we showed in a previous study that a playful<b> stimulus </b>was far more effective than an instructional one.’ Children wrote longer and better-structured stories when they first <b>played with dolls</b> representing characters in the story.

Provo, the organization that <b>came up</b> with the idea, was a group of Dutch activists who wanted to change society. They believed the scheme, which was known as the <b>Witte Fietsenplan</b>, was an answer to the perceived threats of <b>air pollution</b> and consumerism. In the centre of Amsterdam, they painted a <b>small number</b> of used bikes white. They also distributed leaflets describing the dangers of cars and inviting <b>people to use</b> the <b>white bikes</b>. The bikes were then left unlocked at various locations around the city, to be used by anyone in need of transport.","<b>B</b>","Luud Schimmelpennink, a Dutch<b> industrial </b>engineer who still lives and cycles in Amsterdam, was heavily involved in the original scheme. He recalls how the scheme succeeded in attracting a <b>great deal</b> of attention – particularly when it came to publicising Provo’s aims – but struggled to get off the ground. The police were<b> opposed </b>to Provo’s initiatives and almost as soon as the <b>white bikes</b> were distributed around the city, they removed them. However, for Schimmelpennink and for bike-sharing schemes in general, this was just the beginning. ‘The first <b>Witte Fietsenplan</b> was just a<b> symbolic </b>thing,’ he says. ‘We painted a few bikes white, that was all. Things got more serious when I became a member of the Amsterdam <b>city council</b> two <b>years later</b>.’","<b>C</b>","Schimmelpennink seized this opportunity to present a more<b> elaborate </b><b>Witte Fietsenplan</b> to the <b>city council</b>. ‘My idea was that the<b> municipality </b>of Amsterdam would distribute 10,000 <b>white bikes</b> over the city, for everyone to use,’ he explains. ‘I made serious calculations. It turned out that a white bicycle – <b>per person</b>, per kilometer – would cost the<b> municipality </b>only 10% of what it contributed to <b>public transport</b> <b>per person</b> per kilometer.’ Nevertheless, the council unanimously rejected the plan. ‘They said that the bicycle belongs to the past. They saw a glorious future for the car,’ says Schimmelpennink. But he was not in the least discouraged.","<b>D</b>","Schimmelpennink never stopped believing in bike-sharing, and in the mid-90s, two Danes asked for his help to <b>set up</b> a system in Copenhagen. The result was the world’s first large-scale bike-share programme. It worked on a deposit: ‘You dropped a coin in the bike and when you returned it, you got your <b>money back</b>.’ After <b>setting up</b> the Danish system, Schimmelpennink <b>decided to try</b> his luck again in the Netherlands – and this time he succeeded in arousing the interest of the Dutch Ministry of Transport. ‘Times had changed,’ he recalls. ‘People <b>had become</b> more environmentally conscious, and the Danish experiment had proved that bike-sharing was a real possibility.’ A new <b>Witte Fietsenplan</b> was launched in 1999 in Amsterdam. However, riding a white bike was <b>no longer</b> free; it cost one guilder per trip and payment was made with a <b>chip card</b> developed by the Dutch bank Postbank. Schimmelpennink designed conspicuous, sturdy <b>white bikes</b> locked in special racks which could be opened with the <b>chip card</b> – the plan started with 250 bikes, distributed over five stations.","<b>E</b>","Theo Molenaar, who was a system designer for the project, worked alongside Schimmelpennink. ‘I remember when we were testing the bike racks, he announced that he had already designed better ones. But of course, we had to go through with the ones we had.’ The system, however, was prone to vandalism and theft. ‘After every weekend there would always be a couple of bikes missing,’ Molenaar says. ‘I really <b><b>have no</b> idea</b> what people did with them, because they could instantly be recognised as <b>white bikes</b>.’ But the biggest blow came when Postbank decided to abolish the <b>chip card</b>, because it wasn’t profitable. ‘That <b>chip card</b> was pivotal to the system,’ Molenaar says. ‘To continue the project we would have needed to <b>set up</b> another system, but the business partner <b>had lost</b> interest.’","<b>F</b>","Schimmelpennink was disappointed, but – characteristically – not for long. In 2002 he got a call from the French advertising corporation JC Decaux, who wanted to <b>set up</b> his bike-sharing scheme in Vienna. ‘That went <b>really well</b>. After Vienna, they <b>set up</b> a system in Lyon. Then in 2007, Paris followed. That was a decisive moment in the history of bike-sharing.’ The huge and unexpected success of the Parisian bike-sharing programme, which now boasts more than 20,000 bicycles, inspired cities <b>all over the world</b> to set <b>up their own</b> schemes, all modelled on Schimmelpennink’s. ‘It’s wonderful that this happened,’ he says. ‘But financially I didn’t <b>really benefit</b> from it, because I never filed for a patent.’","<b>G</b>","In Amsterdam today, 38% of all trips are made by bike and, along with Copenhagen, it is regarded as one of the two most cycle-friendly capitals in the world – but the city never got another <b>Witte Fietsenplan</b>. Molenaar believes this may be because everybody in Amsterdam already has a bike. Schimmelpennink, however, cannot see that this changes Amsterdam’s need for a bike-sharing scheme. ‘People who travel on the underground don’t carry their bikes around. But often they need additional transport to reach their final destination.’ Although he thinks it is strange that a city like Amsterdam does not have a successful bike-sharing scheme, he is<b> optimistic </b>about the future. ‘In the ‘60s we didn’t stand a chance because people were <b>prepared to give</b> their lives to keep cars in the city. But that<b> mentality </b>has totally changed. Today everybody longs for cities that are not<b> dominated </b>by cars.’"]},{"name":"ARE/14-1-3","paragraph":["<h2>Motivational factors and the hospitality industry</h2>","<b>A </b> critical ingredient in the success of hotels is developing and maintaining<b> superior </b>performance from their employees. How is that accomplished? What Human<b> Resource </b>Management (HRM) practices should organizations invest in to acquire and retain great employees?","Some hotels aim to provide<b> superior </b><b>working conditions</b> for their employees. The idea<b> originated </b>from workplaces – usually in the non-service sector – that emphasized fun and enjoyment as part of work-life balance. By contrast, the service sector, and more specifically hotels, has traditionally not extended these practices to address basic employee needs, such as good <b>working conditions</b>.","Pfeffer (1994) emphasizes that in order to succeed in a global business environment, organizations must make investment in Human<b> Resource </b>Management (HRM) to allow them to acquire employees who possess better skills and capabilities than their competitors. This investment will be to their competitive advantage. Despite this recognition of the importance of employee development, the <b>hospitality industry</b> has historically been<b> dominated </b>by underdeveloped HR practices (Lucas, 2002).","Lucas also points out that ‘the substance of HRM practices does not appear to be designed to<b> foster </b>constructive relations with employees or to represent a managerial approach that enables developing and drawing out the full potential of people, <b>even though</b> employees  may be broadly satisfied with many aspects of their work’ (Lucas, 2002). In addition, or maybe as a result, high employee turnover has been a<b> recurring </b>problem throughout the <b>hospitality industry</b>. Among the many cited reasons are low compensation,<b> inadequate </b>benefits, poor <b>working conditions</b> and compromised employee<b> morale </b>and attitudes (Maroudas <b>et al</b>., 2008).","Ng and Sorensen (2008) demonstrated that when managers provide recognition to employees, motivate employees to <b>work together</b>, and remove obstacles preventing effective performance, employees feel more obligated to stay with the company. This was<b> succinctly </b>summarized by Michel <b>et al</b>. (2013): ‘[P]roviding support to employees gives them the confidence to perform their jobs better and the motivation to stay with the organization.’<b> Hospitality </b>organizations can therefore enhance employee motivation and<b> retention </b>through the development and improvement of their <b>working conditions</b>. These conditions are inherently linked to the working environment.","While it <b>seems like</b>ly that employees’ reactions to their job characteristics could be affected by a predisposition to view their <b>work environment</b> negatively, <b>no evidence</b> exists to support this<b> hypothesis </b>(Spector <b>et al</b>., 2000). However, <b>given the opportunity</b>, <b>many people</b> will <b><b>find some</b>thing</b> to complain about in relation to their workplace (Poulston, 2009). There is a strong link between the perceptions of employees and particular factors of their <b>work environment</b> that are separate from the work itself, including company policies, salary and vacations.","Such conditions are particularly troubling for the luxury hotel market, where high-quality service, requiring a<b> sophisticated </b>approach to HRM, is recognized as a critical source of competitive advantage (Maroudas <b>et al</b>., 2008). In a real sense, the services of hotel employees represent their industry (Schneider and Bowen, 1993). This representation has commonly been limited to guest experiences. This suggests that there has been a<b> dichotomy </b>between the guest environment provided in luxury hotels and the <b>working conditions</b> of their employees.","It is therefore essential for hotel management to develop HRM practices that enable them to inspire and retain<b> competent </b>employees. This requires an understanding of what motivates employees at <b>different levels</b> of management and <b>different stages</b> of their careers (Enz and Siguaw, 2000). This implies that it is beneficial for hotel managers to understand what practices are most favorable to increase employee satisfaction and retention.","Herzberg (1966) proposes that <b>people have</b> <b>two major</b> types of needs, the first being<b> extrinsic </b>motivation factors relating to the context in which work is performed, rather than the work itself. These include <b>working conditions</b> and <b>job security</b>. When these factors are unfavorable, job dissatisfaction may result. Significantly, though, just<b> fulfilling </b>these needs does not result in satisfaction, but only in the<b> reduction </b>of dissatisfaction (Maroudas <b>et al</b>., 2008).","Employees <b>also have</b><b> intrinsic </b>motivation needs or motivators, which include such factors as achievement and recognition. Unlike<b> extrinsic </b>factors, motivator factors may ideally result in job satisfaction (Maroudas <b>et al</b>., 2008). Herzberg’s (1966) theory discusses the need for a ‘balance’ of these <b>two types</b> of needs.","The impact of fun as a motivating factor at work <b>has also</b> been explored. For example, Tews, Michel and Stafford (2013) conducted a study focusing on staff from a chain of themed restaurants in the <b>United States</b>. It was found that fun activities had a favorable impact on performance and manager support for fun had a favorable impact in reducing turnover. Their findings support the view that fun may indeed have a beneficial effect, but the framing of that fun must be carefully aligned with both organizational goals and employee characteristics. ‘Managers must learn how to achieve the <b>delicate balance</b> of allowing employees the freedom to enjoy themselves at work while<b> simultaneously </b><b><b>high level</b>s</b> of performance’ (Tews <b>et al</b>., 2013).","Deery (2008) has recommended several actions that can be adopted at the organizational level to retain good staff as well as assist in <b>balancing <b>work and family</b></b> life. Those particularly appropriate to the <b>hospitality industry</b> <b>include all</b>owing adequate breaks <b>during the working</b> day, staff functions that involve families, and providing health and well-being opportunities."]},{"name":"ARE/14-2-1","paragraph":["<h2>Alexander Henderson (1831-1913)</h2>","Born in Scotland, Henderson emigrated to Canada in 1855 and become a well-known landscape photographer","Alexander Henderson was born in Scotland in 1831 and was the son of a successful merchant. His grandfather, <b>also called</b> Alexander, <b>had found</b>ed the family business, and later became the first chairman of the National Bank of Scotland. The family had extensive landholding in Scotland. Besides its<b> residence </b>in Edinburgh, it owned Press Estate, 650 acres of farmland about 35 miles southeast of the city. The family often stayed at Press Castle, the large mansion on the northern edge of the property, and Alexander spent much of his childhood in the area, playing on the beach near Eyemouth or fishing in the streams nearby.","Even after he went to school at Murcheston Academy on the outskirts of Edinburgh, Henderson returned to Press at weekends. In 1849 he began a three-year apprenticeship to become an accountant. Although he never liked the prospect of a business career, he stayed with it to please his family. In October 1855, however, he emigrated to Canada with his wife Agnes Elder Robertson and they settled in Montreal.","Henderson learned<b> photography </b>in Montreal around the year 1857 and quickly took it up as a serious amateur. He became a personal friend and colleague of the Scottish – Canadian photographer William Notman. The two men made a photographic excursion to Niagara Falls in 1860 and they cooperated on experiments with magnesium<b> flares </b>as a source of artificial light in 1865. They belonged to the same<b> societies </b>and were among the founding members of the Art Association of Montreal. Henderson acted as chairman of the association’s first meeting, which was held in Notman’s studio on 11 January 1860.","In<b> spite </b>of their friendship, their styles of<b> photography </b>were <b>quite different</b>. While Notman’s landscapes were noted for their bold realism, Henderson for the first 20 years of his career produced<b> romantic </b>images, showing the strong influence of the British landscape tradition. His artistic and technical progress was rapid and in 1865 he published his <b>first major</b> collection of landscape photographs. The publication had limited circulation (only seven copies <b>have ever</b> been found), and was called Canadian Views and Studies. The contents of each copy vary significantly and have proved a useful source for evaluating Henderson’s early work.","In 1866, he <b>gave up</b> his business to open a photographic studio, advertising himself as a<b> portrait </b>and landscape photographer. From about 1870 he dropped portraiture to specialize in landscape<b> photography </b>and other views. His numerous<b> photographs </b>of <b>city life</b> revealed in street scenes, houses, and markets are alive with human activity, and although his favourite subject was landscape he usually composed his<b> scenes </b>around such human pursuits as farming the land, cutting ice on a river, or sailing down a woodland stream. There was sufficient demand for these types of<b> scenes </b>and others he took depicting the lumber trade, steamboats and waterfalls to enable him to make a living. There was little competing hobby or amateur<b> photography </b>before the late 1880s because of the time-consuming techniques involved and the weight of equipment. <b>People want</b>ed to buy<b> photographs </b>as<b> souvenirs </b>of a trip or as gifts, and<b> catering </b>to this market, Henderson had stock<b> photographs </b>on display at his studio for mounting, framing, or<b> inclusion </b>in albums.","Henderson frequently exhibited his<b> photographs </b>in Montreal and abroad, in London, Edinburgh, Dublin, Paris, <b>New York</b>, and Philadelphia. He met with greater success in 1877 and 1878 in <b>New York</b> when he won first prizes in the exhibition held by E and H T Anthony and Company for landscapes using the Lambertype process. In 1878 his work won second prize at the world exhibition in Paris.","In the 1890s and 1880s Henderson travelled widely throughout Quebec and Ontario, in Canada, documenting the <b>major cities</b> of the two provinces and many of the villages in Quebec. He was especially fond of the wilderness and often travelled by canoe on the Blanche, du Lièvre, and other noted eastern rivers. He went on several occasions to the Maritimes and in 1872 he sailed by<b> yacht </b>along the lower north shore of the St Lawrence River. That same year, while in the lower St Lawrence River region, he <b>took some</b><b> photographs </b>of the construction of the Intercolonial Railway. This undertaking led in 1875 to a<b> commission </b>from the railway to record the<b> principal </b>structures along the almost-completed line connecting Montreal to Halifax.<b> Commissions </b>from other railways followed. In 1876 he photographed bridges on the Quebec, Montreal, Ottawa and Occidental Railway between Montreal and Ottawa. In 1885 he went west along the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) as far as Rogers Pass in <b>British Columbia</b>, where he took<b> photographs </b>of the mountains and the progress of construction.","In 1892 Henderson accepted a full-time position with the CPR as manager of a photographic department which he was to <b>set up</b> and administer. His duties included spending <b>four months</b> in the field <b>each year</b>. That summer he made his second trip west, photographing extensively along the <b>railway line</b> as far as Victoria. He continued in this post until 1897, when he retired completely from photography.","When Henderson died in 1913, his huge collection of glass negatives was stored in the basement of his house.

As <b>global temperatures</b> continue to rise, we are going to continue to squander more and more energy on keeping our buildings mechanically cool until we have run out of capacity.’","<b>B</b>","Short is calling for a sweeping reinvention of how<b> skyscrapers </b>and major public buildings are designed – to end the reliance on<b> sealed </b>buildings which exist solely via the ‘life support’ system of vast <b>air conditioning</b> units.","Instead, he shows it is entirely possible to accommodate natural<b> ventilation </b>and cooling in large buildings by looking into the past, before the widespread introduction of <b>air conditioning</b> systems, which were ‘relentlessly and aggressively marketed’ by their inventors.","<b>C</b>","Short points out that to make most contemporary buildings habitable, they have to be<b> sealed </b>and air conditioned. The energy use and <b>carbon emissions</b> this generates is<b> spectacular </b>and largely unnecessary. Buildings in the West account for 40-50% of electricity usage, generating<b> substantial </b><b>carbon emissions</b>, and the <b>rest of the world</b> is catching up at a<b> frightening </b>rate.

Of particular interest were those built to the designs of John Shaw Billings, including the first Johns Hopkins Hospital in the US city of Baltimore (1873-1889).","‘We spent <b>three years</b> digitally modelling Billings’ final designs,’ says Short. ‘We put pathogens* in the airstreams, modelled for someone with<b> tuberculosis </b>(TB) coughing in the<b> wards </b>and we found the<b> ventilation </b>systems in the room would have kept other patients safe from harm.","—————-","* pathogens:<b> microorganisms </b>that can cause disease","<b>E</b>","‘We discovered that 19th-century hospital<b> wards </b>could generate up to 24 air changes an hour – that’s similar to the performance of a modern-day, computer-controlled operating theatre.

Miasmas were feared as the<b> principal </b>agents of disease and<b> epidemics </b>for centuries, and were used to explain the spread of infection from the <b>Middle Ages</b> right through to the cholera outbreaks in London and Paris during the 1850s. Foul air, rather than germs, was believed to be the main driver of ‘hospital fever’, leading to disease and frequent death. The prosperous steered clear of hospitals.","While<b> miasma </b>theory has been long since disproved, Short has for the last 30 years advocated a return to some of the <b>building design</b><b> principles </b>produced in its wake.","<b>G</b>","Today, huge amounts of a building’s space and construction cost are given over to <b>air conditioning</b>. ‘But I have designed and built a series of buildings over the past three decades which have tried to reinvent some of these ideas and then measure what happens.","‘To go forward into our new low-energy, low-carbon future, we would be well advised to <b>look back</b> at design before our high-energy, high-carbon present appeared. What is surprising is what a rich legacy we have abandoned.’","<b>H</b>","Successful examples of Short’s approach include the Queen’s Building at De Montfort University in Leicester. Containing as many as 2,000 staff and students, the entire building is naturally ventilated, passively cooled and naturally lit, including the two largest auditoria, each seating more than 150 people. The award-winning building uses a fraction of the electricity of comparable buildings in the UK.","Short contends that glass<b> skyscrapers </b>in London and a<b>round the world</b> will become a liability over the next 20 or 30 years if climate modelling predictions and energy price rises come to pass as expected.","<b>I</b>","He is convinced that sufficiently cooled<b> skyscrapers </b>using the <b>natural environment</b> can be produced in <b>almost any</b> climate.

We are told that we ought to organize our company, our home life, our week, our day and seven our sleep, all as a means to becoming more productive. Every week, countless<b> seminars </b>and workshops <b>take place</b> a<b>round the world</b> to tell a paying public that they ought to structure their lives in <b>order to achieve</b> this.","This rhetoric <b>has also</b> crept into the thinking of <b>business leaders</b> and entrepreneurs, much to the delight of self-proclaimed perfectionists with the need to <b>get everything</b> right. The number of <b>business school</b>s and graduates has massively increased over the past 50 years, essentially teaching people how to organise well.","<b>B</b>","Ironically, however, the number of business that fail <b>has also</b> steadily increased. Work-related stress <b>has increased</b>. A large proportion of workers from all demographics claim to be dissatisfied with the way their work is structured and the way they are managed.","This begs the question: what <b>has gone</b> wrong? Why is it that on paper the drive for organisation seems a sure shot for increasing productivity, but in reality falls well short of what is expected?","<b>C</b>","This has been a problem for a while now. Frederick Taylor was one of the forefathers of scientific management. Writing in the first half of the 20th century, he designed a number of<b> principles </b>to improve the efficiency of the work process, which have since become widespread in modern companies. So the <b>approach has</b> been around for a while.","<b>D</b>","New <b>research suggests</b> that this<b> obsession </b>with efficiency is misguided. The problem is not necessarily the management theories or strategies we use to organise our work; it’s the basic assumptions we hold in approaching how we work. Here it’s the assumption that order is a necessary condition for productivity. This assumption <b>has also</b> fostered the idea that disorder must be<b> detrimental </b>to organizational productivity. The result is that businesses and <b>people spend</b> <b>time and money</b> organising themselves for the sake of organising, rather than actually looking at the end goal and usefulness of such an effort.","<b>E</b>","What’s more, <b>recent studies</b> show that order actually has<b> diminishing </b>returns. Order does increase productivity to a certain extent, but eventually the usefulness of the process of organisation, and the benefit it yields, reduce until the point where <b>any further</b> increase in order reduces productivity. <b>Some argue</b> that in a business, if the cost of formally structuring something outweighs the benefit of doing it, then that thing ought not to be formally structured. Instead, the resources involved can be better used elsewhere.","<b>F</b>","In fact, <b>research shows</b> that, when innovating, the best approach is to create an environment<b> devoid </b>of structure and hierarchy and enable everyone involved to engage as one organic group. These environments can lead to new solutions that, under conventionally structured environments (filled with bottlenecks in term of information flow, power structures, rules, and routines) would never be reached.","<b>G</b>","In recent times <b>companies have</b> slowly started to embrace this disorganisation. Many of them embrace it in terms of perception (embracing the idea of disorder, as<b> opposed </b>to fearing it) and in terms of process (putting mechanisms in place to reduce structure).","For example, Oticon, a large Danish manufacturer of hearing aids, used what it called a ‘spaghetti’ structure in order to reduce the organisation’s<b> rigid </b>hierarchies. This involved scrapping formal job titles and giving staff huge amounts of ownership over their own time and projects. This approach proved to be highly successful initially, with clear improvements in worker productivity in all<b> facets </b>of the business.","In similar fashion, the former chairman of General Electric embraced disorganisation, putting forward the idea of the ‘boundaryless’ organisation. Again, it involves breaking down the barriers between <b>different parts</b> of a company and encouraging virtual collaboration and <b>flexible working</b>.

In other words, <b>people all</b> have<b> unconscious </b>notions – known as ‘<b>implicit theories</b>’ – of intelligence, but <b>no one</b> knows for certain what it actually is. This chapter addresses how people conceptualize intelligence, whatever it may actually be.","But why should we even care what <b>people think</b> intelligence is, as<b> opposed </b>only to valuing whatever it actually is? There are at least <b>four seasons</b> people’s conceptions of intelligence matter.","<b>B</b>","First, <b>implicit <b>theories of intelligence</b></b> drive the way in which people perceive and evaluate their own intelligence and that of others. To better understand the judgments <b>people make</b> about their own and others’ abilities, it is useful to learn about people’s <b>implicit theories</b>. For example, parents’ <b>implicit theories</b> of their children’s language development will determine at what ages they will be willing to make various corrections in their children’s speech. More generally, parents’ <b>implicit <b>theories of intelligence</b></b> will determine at what ages they believe their children are ready to perform various <b>cognitive tasks</b>. Job interviewers will make hiring decisions on the basis of their <b>implicit <b>theories of intelligence</b></b>. People will decide who to be friends with on the basis of such theories. In sum, knowledge about <b>implicit <b>theories of intelligence</b></b> is <b>important because</b> this knowledge is so often used by <b>people to make</b> judgments in the course of their everyday lives.","<b>C</b>","Second, the <b>implicit theories</b> of scientific investigators ultimately give rise to their <b>explicit theories</b>. Thus it is useful to find out what these <b>implicit theories</b> are. <b>Implicit theories</b> provide a framework that is useful in defining the general scope of a<b> phenomenon </b>– especially a not-well-understood phenomenon. These <b>implicit theories</b> can suggest what aspects of the<b> phenomenon </b>have been more or less attended to in previous investigations.","<b>D</b>","Third, <b>implicit theories</b> can be useful when an investigator suspects that existing <b>explicit theories</b> are <b>wrong or misleading</b>. If an investigation of <b>implicit theories</b> reveals little<b> correspondence </b>between the extant implicit and <b>explicit theories</b>, the <b>implicit theories</b> may be wrong. But the possibility also <b>needs to be taken</b> into account that the <b>explicit theories</b> are wrong and in need of correction or supplementation. For example, some <b>implicit <b>theories of intelligence</b></b> suggest the need for expansion of some of our <b>explicit theories</b> of the construct.","<b>E</b>","Finally, understanding <b>implicit <b>theories of intelligence</b></b> can help elucidate developmental and cross-cultural differences. As mentioned earlier, <b>people have</b> expectations for intellectual performances that differ for children of different ages. How these expectations differ is in part a function of culture. For example, expectations for children who participate in Western-style<b> schooling </b>are almost certain to be different from those for children who do not participate in such schooling.","<b>F</b>","<b>I </b> have suggested that there are three major <b>implicit theories</b> of how intelligence relates to society as a whole (Sternberg, 1997). These might be called Hamiltonian, Jeffersonian, and Jacksonian. These views are not based strictly, but rather, loosely, on the<b> philosophies </b>of Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, and Andrew Jackson, three great statesmen in the history of the <b>United States</b>.","<b>G</b>","The Hamiltonian view, which is similar to the Platonic view, is that people are born with <b>different levels</b> of intelligence and that those who are less intelligent need the good offices of the more intelligent to keep them in line, whether they are called <b>government officials</b> or, in Plato’s term, philosopher-kings. Herrnstein and Murray (1994) <b>seem to have</b> shared this belief when they wrote about the<b> emergence </b>of a cognitive (high-IQ) elite, which eventually would <b>have to take</b><b> responsibility </b>for the largely irresponsible masses of non-elite (low-IQ) people who cannot <b>take care</b> of themselves. Left to themselves, the unintelligent would create, as they <b>always have</b> created, a kind of chaos.","<b>H</b>","The Jeffersonian view is that people should have equal opportunities, but they do not necessarily avail themselves equally of these<b> opportunities </b>and are not necessarily equally rewarded for their accomplishments. People are rewarded for what they accomplish, if given equal opportunity. Low achievers are not rewarded to the same extent as high achievers. In the Jeffersonian view, the goal of education is not to favor or<b> foster </b>an elite, as in the Hamiltonian tradition, but rather to allow children the<b> opportunities </b>to make full use of the skills they have. My own views are similar to these (Sternberg, 1997).","<b>I</b>","The Jacksonian view is that all people are equal, not only as <b>human beings</b> but in terms of their<b> competencies </b>– that <b>one person</b> would serve as well as another in government or on a jury or in <b>almost any</b> position of responsibility. In this view of democracy, people are essentially intersubstitutable except for<b> specialized </b>skills, all of which can be learned. In this view, we do not need or <b>want any</b> institutions that might lead to favoring one group over another.","<b>J</b>","<b>Implicit <b>theories of intelligence</b></b> and of the relationship of intelligence to society perhaps need to be considered more carefully than they have been because they often serve as underlying presuppositions for <b>explicit theories</b> and even experimental designs that are then taken as scientific contributions. Until scholars are able to discuss their <b>implicit theories</b> and thus their assumptions, they are likely to miss the point of what others are saying when discussing their <b>explicit theories</b> and their data."]},{"name":"ARE/14-3-2","paragraph":["<h2>Saving bugs to find new drugs</h2>","Zoologist Ross Piper looks at the potential of insects in<b> pharmaceutical </b>research","<b>A</b>","More drugs than you might think are derived from, or inspired by,<b> compounds </b>found in living things.

The<b> larvae </b>of a <b>few other</b> insect<b> species </b>are being investigated for the potent<b> antimicrobial </b>compounds they produce. Meanwhile, a<b> compound </b>from the venom of the wasp Polybia paulista has potential in cancer treatment.","<b>F</b>","Why is it that insects <b>have received</b> relatively little attention in bioprospecting? Firstly, there are so many insects that, without some manner of targeted approach, investigating this huge <b>variety of species</b> is a<b> daunting </b>task. Secondly, insects are <b>generally very</b> small, and the glands inside them that<b> secrete </b>potentially <b>useful compounds</b> are smaller still. This can <b>make it difficult</b> to obtain sufficient quantities of the<b> compound </b>for subsequent testing. Thirdly, although we consider insects to be everywhere, the reality of this ubiquity is vast numbers of a few extremely common species. Many insect<b> species </b>are infrequently encountered and <b>very difficult</b> to rear in captivity, which, again, can leave us with insufficient material to work with.","<b>G</b>","My colleagues and I at Aberystwyth <b>University in the UK</b> <b>have developed</b> an approach in which we use our knowledge of<b> ecology </b>as a guide to target our efforts. The creatures that particularly interest us are the many insects that<b> secrete </b>powerful poison for subduing<b> prey </b>and keeping it fresh for future consumption. There are even more insects that are masters of<b> exploiting </b>filthy habitats, such as faeces and carcasses, where they are regularly challenged by thousands of micro-organisms. These <b>insects have</b> many<b> antimicrobial </b>compounds for dealing with pathogenic<b> bacteria </b>and fungi, suggesting that there is certainly potential to find many<b> compounds </b>that can serve as or inspire new antibiotics.","<b>H</b>","Although <b>natural history</b> knowledge points us in the right direction, it doesn’t solve the problems associated with obtaining <b>useful compounds</b> from insects. Fortunately, it is now possible to snip out the stretches of the insect’s DNA that carry the codes for the interesting<b> compounds </b>and insert them into cell lines that allow larger quantities to be produced. And although the road from isolating and characterizing<b> compounds </b>with desirable qualities to developing a commercial product is <b>very long</b> and full of pitfalls, the variety of successful animal-derived pharmaceuticals on the market demonstrates there is a precedent here that is worth exploring.","<b>I</b>","With every bit of wilderness that disappears, we deprive ourselves of potential medicines. As much as I’d love to help develop a groundbreaking insect-derived medicine, my main motivation for looking at insects in this way is conservation. I sincerely believe that all species, however small and seemingly insignificant, have a right to exist for their own sake. If we can shine a light on the darker recesses of nature’s medicine cabinet,<b> exploring </b>the useful chemistry of the most diverse animals on the planet, I believe we can make <b>people think</b> differently about the value of nature."]},{"name":"ARE/14-3-3","paragraph":["<h2>The Power of Play</h2>","<b>Virtually every</b> child, the world over, plays. The drive to play is so intense that children will do so in any circumstances, for instance when they <b>have no</b> real toys, or when parents do not actively encourage the behavior. In the eyes of a young child, running, pretending, and building are fun. Researchers and educators know that these playful activities benefit the development of the whole child across social, cognitive, physical, and emotional domains. Indeed, play is such an instrumental component to healthy child development that the United Nation High<b> Commission </b>on Human Rights (1989) recognized play as a fundamental right of every child.","Yet, while experts continue to expound a powerful argument for the <b>importance of play</b> in children’s lives, the actual time children spend playing continues to decrease. Today, children play <b>eight hours</b> less <b>each week</b> than their counterparts did <b>two decades</b> ago (Elkind 2008). Under pressure of rising academic standards, play is being replaced by test preparation in kindergartens and grade schools, and parents who aim to give their preschoolers a leg up are led to believe that flashcards and educational ‘toys’ are the path to success. Our society has created a false<b> dichotomy </b>between play and learning","Through play, children learn to regulate their behavior, lay the foundations for later learning in science and mathematics, figure out the complex negotiations of<b> social </b>relationships, build a<b> repertoire </b>of creative problem-solving skills, and so much more. There is also an <b>important role</b> for adults in guiding children through <b>playful learning</b> opportunities.","Full<b> consensus </b>on a formal definition of play continues to elude the researchers and<b> theorists </b>who study it. Definitions range from discrete descriptions of various types of play such as physical, construction, language, or<b> symbolic </b>play (Miler & Almon 2009), to lists of broad criteria, based on observations and attitudes, that are meant to capture the essence of all play behaviors (e.g. Rubin <b>et al</b>. 1983).","<b>A </b> majority of the contemporary definitions of play focus on <b>several key</b> criteria. The founder of the National Institute for Play, Stuart Brown, has described play as ‘anything that<b> spontaneously </b>is done for its own sake’. More specifically, he says it ‘appears purposeless, produces pleasure and joy, [and] leads one to the <b>next stage</b> of mastery’ (as quoted in Tippett 2008). Similarly, Miller and Almon (2009) say that play includes ‘activities that are freely chosen and directed by children and arise from<b> intrinsic </b>motivation’. Often, play is defined along a<b> continuum </b>as more or less playful using the following set of behavioral and dispositional criteria (e.g. Rubin <b>et al</b>. 1983).","Play is pleasurable: Children must enjoy the activity or it is not play. It is<b> intrinsically </b>motivated: Children engage in play simply for the satisfaction the behavior itself brings. It <b>has no</b><b> extrinsically </b>motivated function or goal. Play is process oriented: When children play, the means are more important than the ends. It is freely chosen,<b> spontaneous </b>and voluntary. If a child is pressured, they will likely not think of the activity as play. Play is actively engaged: Players must be physically and/or<b> mentally </b>involved in the activity. Play is non-literal. It involves make-believe.","According to this view, children’s playful behaviors can range in degree from 0% to 100% playful. Rubin and colleagues did not assign greater weight to <b>any one</b> dimension in determining playfulness; however, <b>other researchers</b> have suggested that process orientation and a lack of obvious functional purpose may be the <b>most important</b> aspects of play (e.g. Pellegrini 2009).","From the<b> perspective </b>of a continuum, play can thus<b> blend </b>with other motives and attitudes that are less playful, such as work. Unlike play, work is typically not viewed as enjoyable and it is<b> extrinsically </b>motivated (i.e. it is goal oriented). Researcher Joan Goodman (1994) suggested that hybrid forms of work and play are not a detriment to learning; rather, they can provide optimal contexts for learning. For example, a child may be engaged in a difficult, goal-directed activity <b>set up</b> by their teacher, but they may still be actively engaged and<b> intrinsically </b>motivated. At this mid-point between play and work, the child’s motivation, coupled with guidance from an adult, can create robust<b> opportunities </b>for <b>playful learning</b>.","Critically, <b>recent research</b> supports the idea that adults can<b> facilitate </b>children’s learning while maintaining a playful approach in interactions known as ‘<b>guided play</b>’ (Fisher <b>et al</b>. 2011). The adult’s role in play varies as a function of their educational goals and the child’s developmental level (Hirsch-Pasek <b>et al</b>. 2009).","<b>Guided play</b> takes two forms. At a very basic level, adults can enrich the child’s environment by providing objects or experiences that promote aspects of a curriculum. In the more direct form of <b>guided play</b>, parents or other adults can support children’s play by joining in the fun as a co-player, raising thoughtful questions, commenting on children’s discoveries, or encouraging further<b> exploration </b>or new<b> facets </b>to the child’s activity. Although <b>playful learning</b> can be somewhat structured, it must also be child-centered (Nicolopolou <b>et al</b>. 2006). Play should<b> stem </b>from the child’s own desire.","Both free and <b>guided play</b> are essential elements in a child-centered approach to <b>playful learning</b>.<b> Intrinsically </b>motivated free play provides the child with true autonomy, while <b>guided play</b> is an avenue through which parents and educators can provide more targeted learning experiences. In either case, play should be actively engaged, it should be predominantly child-directed, and it must be fun."]},{"name":"ARE/14-4-1","paragraph":["<h2>The secret of staying young</h2>","Pheidole dentata, a native ant of the south-eastern U.S., isn’t immortal. But <b>scientists have</b> found that it doesn’t <b><b>seem to show</b> any</b> signs of aging. Old workers ants can do everything just as well as the youngsters, and their brains appear just as sharp. ‘We get a picture that these ants <b>really do</b>n’t decline,’ says Ysabel Giraldo, who studies the ants for her doctoral thesis at Boston University.","Such age-defying feats are rare in the <b>animal kingdom</b>. Naked<b> mole </b>rats can live for almost 30 years and stay fit for nearly their entire lives. They can still reproduce even when old, and they <b>never get</b> cancer. But the <b>vast majority</b> of animals<b> deteriorate </b>with age <b>just like</b> <b>people do</b>. Like the naked<b> mole </b>rat, ants are<b> social </b>creatures that usually live in highly organised colonies. ‘It’s this<b> social </b>complexity that makes P.<b> dentata </b>useful for studying aging in people,’ says Giraldo, now at the California <b>Institute of Technology</b>. Humans are also highly social, a trait that has been connected to healthier aging. By contrast, most animal studies of aging use mice, worms or fruit flies, which all lead much more isolated lives.","In the lab, P.<b> dentata </b>worker ants typically live for around 140 days. Giraldo focused on ants at four age ranges: 20 to 22 days, 45 to 47 days, 95 to 97 days and 120 to 122 days. Un<b>like all</b> previous studies, which only<b> estimated </b>how old the ants were, her work tracked the ants from the time the pupae became adults, so she knew their exact ages. Then she put them through a range of tests.","Giraldo watched how well the ants took care of the young of the colony, recording how often each ant attended to, carried and fed them. She compared how well 20-day-old and 95-day-old ants followed the telltale<b> scent </b>that the insects usually leave to mark a<b> trail </b>to food. She tested how ants responded to light and also measured how active they were by counting how often ants in a small dish walked across a line. And she experimented with how ants react to live prey: a tethered fruit fly. Giraldo expected the <b>older ants</b> to perform poorly in all these tasks. But the elderly insects were all <b>good care</b>takers and trail-followers – the 95-day-old ants could track the<b> scent </b>even longer than their younger counterparts. They all responded do light well, and the <b>older ants</b> were more active. And when it came to reacting to prey, the <b>older ants</b> attacked the poor fruit fly just as aggressively as the young ones did, flaring their mandibles or pulling at the fly’s legs.","Then Giraldo compared the brains of 20-day-old and 95-day-ole ants, identifying any cells that were close to death. She saw no major differences with age, nor was there any difference in the location of the<b> dying </b>cells, showing that age didn’t seem to affect specific brain functions. Ants and other <b>insects have</b> structures in their brains called mushroom bodies, which are important for processing information, learning and memory. She also <b>wanted to see</b> if aging affects the density of synaptic complexes within these structures – regions where<b> neurons </b>come together. Again, the answer was no. what was more, he old ants didn’t experience any drop in the levels of either<b> serotonin </b>or<b> dopamine </b>– brain chemicals whose decline often coincides with aging. In humans, for example, a decrease in<b> serotonin </b>has been linked to Alzheimer’s disease.","‘This is the <b>first time</b> any<b>one has</b> looked at both behavioral and<b> neural </b>changes in these ants so thoroughly,’ says Giraldo, who recently published the findings in the Proceeding of the Royal Society B. <b>Scientists have</b> looked at some similar aspects in bees, but the results of recent bee studies were mixed – <b>some studies</b> showed age-related declines, which biologists call senescence, and others didn’t. ‘For now, the study raises more questions than it answers,’ Giraldo says, ‘including how P.<b> dentata </b>stays in such good shape.’","Also, if the ants don’t<b> deteriorate </b>with age, why do they die at all? Out in the wild, the ants probably don’t live for a full 140 days thanks to predators, disease and just being in an environment that’s much harsher than the comforts of the lab. ‘The lucky ants that do live into old age may suffer a<b> steep </b>decline just before dying,’ Giraldo says, but she can’t say for sure because her study wasn’t designed to follow an ant’s final moments.","‘It will be important to extend these findings to <b>other species</b> of<b> social </b>insects,’ says Gene E. Robinson, an entomologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. This ant might be unique, or it might represent a broader pattern among <b>other social</b> bugs with possible clues to the science of aging in larger animals. Either way, it seems that for these ants, age <b>really do</b>esn’t matter."]},{"name":"ARE/14-4-2","paragraph":["<h2>Why zoos are good</h2>","<b>Scientist David</b> Hone makes the case for zoos","<b>A</b>","In my view, it is perfectly possible for <b>many species</b> of animals living in zoos or wildlife parks to have a quality of life as high as, or higher than, in the wild. Animals in good zoos get a varied and high-quality diet with all the supplements required, and any illnesses they might have will be treated. Their movement might be somewhat restricted, but they have a safe environment in which to live, and they are spared bullying and<b> social </b>ostracism by others of their kind. They do not suffer from the threat or stress of predators, or the irritation and pain of<b> parasites </b>or injuries. The average captive animal will <b>have a great</b>er <b>life expectancy</b> compared with its wild counterpart, and will not die of drought, of<b> starvation </b>or in the<b> jaws </b>of a predator. A lot of very nasty things happen to truly ‘wild’ animals that simply don’t happen in good zoos, and to view a life that is ‘free’ as one that is automatically ‘good’ is, I think, an error. Furthermore, zoos serve <b>several key</b> purposes.","<b>B</b>","Firstly, zoos aid conservation. Colossal <b>numbers of species</b> are becoming extinct across the world, and many more are increasingly<b> threatened </b>and therefore risk extinction. Moreover, some of these collapses have been sudden, dramatic and unexpected, or were simply discovered very late in the day. A<b> species </b>protected in<b> captivity </b>can be bred up to provide a<b> reservoir </b>population against a population crash or extinction in the wild. A good number of<b> species </b>only exist in captivity, with many of these living in zoos. Still more only exist in the wild because they have been reintroduced from zoos, or have <b>wild populations</b> that have been boosted by captive bred animals. Without these efforts there would be fewer<b> species </b>alive today. Although<b> reintroduction </b>successes are few and far between, the numbers are increasing, and the very fact that <b>species have</b> been saved or reintroduced as a result of captive breeding proves the value of such initiatives.","<b>C</b>","Zoos <b>also provide</b> education. <b>Many children</b> and adults, especially those in cities, will never see a wild animal beyond a fox or pigeon. While it is true that television documentaries are becoming ever more detailed and impressive, and many <b>natural history</b><b> specimens </b>are on display in museums, there really is nothing to compare with seeing a living creature in the flesh, hearing it, smelling it, watching what it does and having the time to absorb details. That alone will bring a greater understanding and<b> perspective </b>to many, and hopefully give them a greater appreciation for wildlife, conservation efforts and how they can contribute.","<b>D</b>","In addition to this, there is also the education that can <b>take place</b> in zoos through signs, <b>talks and presentations</b> which directly communicate information to visitors about the animals they are seeing and their place in the world. This was an area where zoos used to be lacking, but they are now increasingly<b> sophisticated </b>in their communication and outreach work. Many <b>zoos also</b> work directly to educate conservation workers in <b>other countries</b>, or send their animal keepers abroad to contribute their knowledge and skills to those working in zoos and reserves, thereby helping to improve conditions and reintroductions <b>all over the world</b>.","<b>E</b>","<b>Zoos also</b> play a <b>key role</b> in research. If we are to save wild<b> species </b>and restore and repair ecosystems we <b>need to know</b> about how key<b> species </b>live, act and react. Being able to undertake research on animals in zoos where there is less risk and fewer variables means real changes can be effected on <b>wild populations</b>. Finding out about, for example, the oestrus cycle of an animal of its breeding rate helps us manage <b>wild populations</b>. Procedures such as capturing and moving at-risk or dangerous individuals are bolstered by knowledge gained in zoos about doses for anaesthetics, and by experience in handling and transporting animals. This can make a real difference to conservation efforts and to the<b> reduction </b>of human-animal conflicts, and can provide a knowledge base for helping with the increasing threats of <b>habitat destruction</b> and <b>other problems</b>.","<b>F</b>","In conclusion, considering the many ongoing global threats to the environment, it is hard for me to see zoos as <b>anything other</b> than essential to the long-term survival of<b> numerous </b>species. They are vital not just in terms of protecting animals, but as a means of learning about them to aid those still in the wild, as well as educating and informing the general population about these animals and their world so that they can assist or at least accept the need to be more environmentally conscious. Without them, the world would be, and would increasingly become, a much poorer place."]},{"name":"ARE/14-4-3","paragraph":["<h2>Chelsea Rochman</h2>","Chelsea Rochman, an<b> ecologist </b>at the University of California, Davis, has been trying to answer a dismal question: Is everything terrible, or are things just very, very bad?","Rochman is a member of the National Center for<b> Ecological </b>Analysis and Synthesis’s marine-debris working group, a collection of scientists who study, among <b>other things</b>, the growing problem of marine debris, <b>also known</b> as <b>ocean trash</b>. Plenty of <b>studies have</b> sounded alarm bells about the state of marine debris; in a <b>recent paper</b> <b>published in the journal</b> Ecology, Rochman and her colleagues set out to determine how many of those perceived risks are real.","Often, <b>Rochman says</b>, scientists will end a paper by<b> speculating </b>about the broader impacts of what they’ve found. For example, a study could show that certain seabirds eat plastic bags, and go on to warn that whole bird populations are at risk of<b> dying </b>out. ‘But the truth was that nobody had yet tested those perceived threats,’ <b>Rochman says</b>. ‘There wasn’t a lot of information.’","Rochman and her colleagues examined more than a hundred papers on the impacts of marine<b> debris </b>that were published through 2013. Within each paper, they asked what threats scientists had studied – 366 perceived threats in all – and what they’d actually found.","In 83 percent of cases, the perceived dangers of <b>ocean trash</b> were proven true. In the remaining cases, the working group found the studies had weaknesses in design and content which affected the validity of their conclusions – they lacked a control group, for example, or used faulty statistics.","Strikingly, <b>Rochman says</b>, <b>only one</b> well-designed study failed to find the effect it was looking for, an investigation of<b> mussels </b>ingesting microscopic bits. The plastic moved from the mussels’ stomachs to their bloodstreams, scientists found, and stayed there for weeks – but didn’t seem to stress out the shellfish.","While<b> mussels </b>may be fine eating trash, though, the analysis also gave a clearer picture of the <b>many ways</b> that <b>ocean debris</b> is bothersome.","Within the studies they looked at, most of the proven threats came from plastic debris, rather than other <b>materials like</b> metal or wood. Most of the dangers also involved large pieces of<b> debris </b>– animals getting entangled in trash, for example, or eating it and<b> severely </b>injuring themselves.","But a lot of <b>ocean debris</b> is ‘microplastic’, or pieces smaller than five millimeters. These may be ingredients used in<b> cosmetics </b>and toiletries, fibers<b> shed </b>by<b> synthetic </b>clothing in the wash, or eroded remnants of larger debris. Compared to the number of studies investigating large-scale debris, Rochman’s group found little research on the effects of these tiny bits. ‘There are a lot of open questions still for microplastic,’ <b>Rochman says</b>, though she notes that more papers on the subject have been published since 2013, the<b> cutoff </b>point for the group’s analysis.","There are also, she adds, a lot of open questions about the ways that <b>ocean debris</b> can lead to sea-creature death. Many <b>studies have</b> looked at how plastic affects an individual animal, or that animal’s tissues or cells, rather than whole populations. And in the lab, scientists often use higher<b> concentrations </b>of plastic than what’s really in the ocean. None of that tells us how <b>many birds</b> or fish or <b><b>sea turtle</b>s</b> could die from plastic<b> pollution </b>– or how<b> deaths </b>in <b>one species</b> could affect that animal’s predators, or the rest of the ecosystem.","‘We need to be asking more ecologically<b> relevant </b>questions,’ <b>Rochman says</b>. Usually, scientists don’t <b>know exactly</b> how disasters such as a tanker accidentally spilling its whole cargo of oil and<b> polluting </b>huge areas of the ocean will affect the environment until after they’ve happened. ‘We don’t ask the right questions early enough,’ she says. But if<b> ecologists </b>can understand how the slow-moving effect of <b>ocean trash</b> is damaging ecosystems, they might be able to prevent things from getting worse.","Asking the right questions can help policy makers, and the public, figure out where to focus their attention. The problems that look or sound <b>most dramatic</b> may not be the <b><b>best place</b>s</b> to start. For example, the name of the ‘Great Pacific Garbage Patch’ – a collection of marine<b> debris </b>in the northern <b>Pacific Ocean</b> – might conjure up a vast, floating trash island. In reality though, much of the<b> debris </b>is tiny or below the surface; a person could sail through the area without seeing any trash at all. A Dutch <b>group called</b> ‘The Ocean Cleanup’ is currently working on plans to put mechanical devices in the Pacific Garbage Patch and similar areas to suck up plastic. But a <b>recent paper</b> used simulations to show that strategically positioning the cleanup devices closer to shore would more effectively reduce<b> pollution </b>over the <b>long term</b>.","‘I think clearing <b>up some</b> of these misperceptions is <b>really important</b>,’ <b>Rochman says</b>. Among scientists as well as in the media, she says, ‘A lot of the images about strandings and entanglement and all of that cause the perception that plastic<b> debris </b>is killing everything in the ocean.’ Interrogating the existing scientific literature can help<b> ecologists </b>figure out which problems <b>really need</b> addressing, and which ones they’d be better off – like the<b> mussels </b>– absorbing and ignoring."]},{"name":"ARE/15-1-1","paragraph":["<h2>Nutmeg – a valuable spice</h2>","The<b> nutmeg </b>tree, Myristica fragrans, is a large evergreen tree native to <b>Southeast Asia</b>. Until the late 18th century, it only grew in one place in the world: a <b>small group</b> of islands in the Banda Sea, part of the Moluccas – or<b> Spice </b>Islands – in northeastern Indonesia. The tree is thickly branched with dense foliage of tough, dark green oval leaves, and produces small, yellow, bell-shaped flowers and<b> pale </b>yellow pear-shaped fruits. The fruit is encased in a<b> flesh </b>husk. When the fruit is ripe, this<b> husk </b>splits into two halves along a ridge running the length of the fruit. Inside is a purple-brown<b> shiny </b>seed, 2-3 cm long by about 2 cm across, surrounded by a lacy red or crimson covering called an ‘aril’. These are the sources of the two spices<b> nutmeg </b>and mace, the former being produced from the<b> dried </b>seed and the<b> latter </b>from the aril.","Nutmeg was a highly prized and costly ingredient in European<b> cuisine </b>in the <b>Middle Ages</b>, and was used as a flavouring, medicinal, and preservative agent. Throughout this period, the Arabs were the<b> exclusive </b>importers of the<b> spice </b>to Europe. They sold<b> nutmeg </b>for high prices to merchants based in Venice, but they never revealed the exact location of the source of this extremely valuable commodity. The Arab-Venetian<b> dominance </b>of the trade finally ended in 1512, when the Portuguese reached the <b>Banda Islands</b> and began<b> exploiting </b>its <b>precious resources</b>.","Always in danger of competition from<b> neighbouring </b>Spain, the Portuguese began subcontracting their<b> spice </b>distribution to Dutch traders. Profits began to flow into the Netherlands, and the Dutch commercial fleet<b> swiftly </b>grew into <b>one of the <b>largest in the world</b></b>. The Dutch quietly gained control of most of the shipping and trading of<b> spices </b>in Northern Europe. Then, in 1580, Portugal fell under Spanish rule, and by the end of the 16th century the Dutch <b>found themselves</b> locked out of the market. As prices for pepper, nutmeg, and other<b> spices </b>soared across Europe, they decided to fight back.","In 1602, Dutch merchants founded the VOC, a trading corporation better known as the Dutch East India Company. By 1617, the VOC was the richest commercial operation in the world. The company had 50,000 employees worldwide, with a private army of 30,000 men and a<b> fleet </b>of 200 ships. At the <b>same time</b>, <b>thousands of people</b> across Europe were<b> dying </b>of the plague, a highly<b> contagious </b>and deadly disease. Doctors were<b> desperate </b>for a way to stop the spread of this disease, and they decided<b> nutmeg </b>held the cure. Everybody wanted nutmeg, and many were willing to spare no expense to have it.<b> Nutmeg </b>bought for a few pennies in Indonesia could be sold for 68,000 times its original cost on the streets of London. The only problem was the short supply. And that’s where the Dutch found their opportunity.","The <b>Banda Islands</b> were ruled by local sultans who insisted on maintaining a<b> neutral </b>trading policy towards foreign powers. This allowed them to avoid the presence of Portuguese or Spanish troops on their soil, but it also left them unprotected from other invaders. In 1621, the <b>Dutch arrived</b> and took over. Once securely in control of the Bandas, the Dutch went to work protecting their new investment. They concentrated all<b> nutmeg </b>production into a few easily guarded areas, uprooting and destroying any trees outside the<b> plantation </b>zones. Anyone caught growing a nutmeg<b> seedling </b>or carrying seeds without the proper authority was<b> severely </b>punished. In addition, all exported<b> nutmeg </b>was covered with<b> lime </b>to <b>make sure</b> there was no chance a<b> fertile </b>seed which could be grown elsewhere would leave the islands. There was <b>only one</b> obstacle to Dutch domination. One of the <b>Banda Islands</b>, a sliver of land called Run, only 3 km long by less than 1 km wide, was under the control of the British. After decades of fighting for control of this tiny island, the Dutch and British arrived at a<b> compromise </b>settlement, the Treaty of Breda, in 1667. Intent on securing their hold over every nutmeg-producing island, the Dutch offered a trade: if the British would give them the island of Run, they would in turn give Britain a distant and <b>much less</b> valuable island in <b>North America</b>. The British agreed. That other island was Manhattan, which is how New Amsterdam became <b>New York</b>. The Dutch now had a<b> monopoly </b>over the<b> nutmeg </b>trade which would last for another century.","Then, in 1770, a Frenchman named Pierre Poivre successfully<b> smuggled </b>nutmeg plants to safety in Mauritius, an island off the coast of Africa. Some of these were later exported to the Caribbean where they thrived, especially on the island of Grenada. Next, in 1778, a volcanic<b> eruption </b>in the Banda region caused a<b> tsunami </b>that wiped out half the<b> nutmeg </b>groves. Finally, in 1809, the British returned to Indonesia and seized the <b>Banda Islands</b> by force.

At present, the average car spends more than 90 percent of its life parked. Automation means that initiatives for car-sharing become much more viable, particularly in urban areas with significant travel demand.

Our desire to discover, and then share that new-found knowledge, is part of what makes us human – indeed, this has <b>played an important</b> part in our success as a species. Long before the first<b> caveman </b>slumped down beside the fire and grunted news that there were plenty of<b> wildebeest </b>over yonder, our ancestors had<b> learnt </b>the value of sending out scouts to investigate the unknown. This questing nature of ours undoubtedly helped our<b> species </b>spread around the globe, just as it nowadays <b>no doubt</b> helps the last nomadic Penan maintain their existence in the<b> depleted </b>forests of Borneo, and a visitor negotiate the subways of <b>New York</b>.","Over the years, we’ve come to think of<b> explorers </b>as a<b> peculiar </b>breed – different from the rest of us, different from those of us who are merely ‘well travelled’, even; and perhaps there is a type of person more suited to seeking out the new, a type of<b> caveman </b>more inclined to risk venturing out. That, however, doesn’t take away from the fact that we <b>all have</b> this enquiring instinct, even today; and that in <b>all sorts</b> of professions – whether artist, marine biologist or astronomer – borders of the unknown are being tested <b>each day</b>.","Thomas Hardy set some of his novels in Egdon Heath, a fictional area of<b> uncultivated </b>land, and used the landscape to suggest the desires and fears of his characters. He is delving into matters we all recognise because they are common to humanity. This is surely an act of exploration, and into a world as remote as the author chooses.<b> Explorer </b>and travel writer Peter Fleming talks of the moment when the<b> explorer </b>returns to the existence he has left behind with his loved ones. The traveller ‘who has for weeks or months seen himself only as a puny and<b> irrelevant </b>alien crawling laboriously over a country in which he <b>has no</b> roots and no background, suddenly encounters his other self, a relatively solid figure, with a place in the minds of certain people’.","In this book about the<b> exploration </b>of the earth’s surface, I have confined myself to those whose travels were real and who also aimed at more than personal discovery. But that still left me with another problem: the word ‘explorer’ <b>has become</b> associated with a past era. We think back to a golden age, as if<b> exploration </b>peaked somehow in the 19th century – as if the process of discovery is now on the decline, though the truth is that we <b>have named</b> <b>only one</b> and a half million of this planet’s species, and there may be more than 10 million – and that’s not including bacteria. We <b>have studied</b> only 5 <b>per cent</b> of the<b> species </b>we know. We have scarcely mapped the ocean floors, and know even less about ourselves; we <b>fully understand</b> the workings of only 10 <b>per cent</b> of our brains.","Here is how some of today’s ‘explorers’ define the word. Ran Fiennes,<b> dubbed </b>the ‘greatest living explorer’, said, ‘An<b> explorer </b>is <b>someone who has</b> <b>done some</b>thing that no human has done before – and also <b>done some</b>thing<b> scientifically </b>useful.’ Chris Bonington, a leading mountaineer, felt<b> exploration </b>was to be found in the act of physically touching the unknown: ‘You <b>have to have</b> gone somewhere new.’ Then Robin Hanbury-Tenison, a campaigner on behalf of remote so-called ‘tribal’ peoples, said, ‘A traveller simply records information about some far-off world, and reports back; but an<b> explorer </b>changes the world.’ Wilfred Thesiger, who crossed Arabia’s Empty<b> Quarter </b>in 1946, and belongs to an<b> era </b>of unmechanised travel now lost to the rest of us, <b>told me</b>, ‘If I’d gone across by camel when I could <b>have gone</b> by car, it would have been a stunt.’ To him,<b> exploration </b>meant bringing back information from a remote place regardless of any great self-discovery.","Each definition is <b>slightly different</b> – and tends to reflect the field of<b> endeavour </b>of each pioneer. It was the same whoever I asked: the prominent historian would say<b> exploration </b>was a thing of the past, the cutting-edge scientist would say it was of the present. And so on. They each set their own particular criteria; the common factor in their approach being that they <b>all had</b>, <b>un<b>like many</b></b> of us who simply enjoy travel or discovering new things, both a very definite objective from the outset and also a desire to record their findings.","I’d best declare my own bias. As a writer, I’m interested in the<b> exploration </b>of ideas. I’ve done a <b>great many</b> expeditions and <b>each one</b> was unique. I’ve lived for months alone with isolated groups of <b>people all</b> a<b>round the world</b>, even two ‘uncontacted tribes’. But none of these things is of the slightest interest to anyone unless, through my books, I’ve found a new slant, explored a new idea. Why? Because the <b>world has</b> moved on. The time <b>has long</b> passed for the great continental<b> voyages </b>– another walk to the poles, another crossing of the Empty Quarter. We know how the land surface of our planet lies;<b> exploration </b>of it is now down to the details – the habits of microbes, say, or the<b> grazing </b>behaviour of buffalo. Aside from the deep sea and deep underground, it’s the<b> era </b>of specialists.

Transportation is<b> estimated </b>to account for 30% of energy consumption in most of the world’s most developed nations, so lowering the need for energy-using<b> vehicles </b>is essential for decreasing the <b>environmental impact</b> of mobility. But as more and more <b>people move</b> to cities, it is important to think about <b>other kinds</b> of<b> sustainable </b>travel too. The ways we travel affect our physical and mental health, our<b> social </b>lives, our access to work and culture, and the air we breathe. Engineers are tasked with changing how we travel round cities through <b>urban design</b>, but the engineering industry still works on the assumptions that led to the creation of the energy-consuming <b><b>transport system</b>s</b> we <b>have no</b>w: the<b> emphasis </b>placed solely on efficiency, speed, and quantitative data. We need<b> radical </b>changes, to make it healthier, more enjoyable, and less environmentally damaging to travel around cities.","<b>B</b>","Dance might hold some of the answers. That is not to suggest everyone should dance their way to work, however healthy and happy it might make us, but rather that the techniques used by<b> choreographers </b>to experiment with and design movement in dance could provide engineers with tools to<b> stimulate </b><b>new ideas</b> in city-making. Richard Sennett, an influential urbanist and sociologist who has transformed ideas about the way cities are made, argues that <b>urban design</b> has suffered from a separation between <b>mind and body</b> since the introduction of the architectural blueprint.","<b>C</b>","Whereas<b> medieval </b>builders improvised and adapted construction through their<b> intimate </b>knowledge of materials and personal experience of the conditions on a site, <b>building design</b>s are now<b> conceived </b>and stored in media technologies that detach the designer from the physical and<b> social </b>realities they are creating. While the design practices created by these <b>new technologies</b> are essential for managing the technical complexity of the modern city, they have the drawback of simplifying reality in the process.","<b>D</b>","To illustrate, Sennett discusses the Peachtree Center in Atlanta, USA, a development typical of the modernist approach to <b>urban planning</b><b> prevalent </b>in the 1970s. Peachtree created a grid of streets and towers intended as a new pedestrian-friendly downtown for Atlanta. According to Sennett, this failed because its <b>designers had</b> invested <b>too much</b> faith in computer-aided design to tell them how it would operate. They failed to <b>take into account</b> that purpose-built street cafés could not operate in the hot sun without the protective awnings common in older buildings, and would need energy-consuming <b>air conditioning</b> instead, or that its giant <b>car park</b> would feel so unwelcoming that it would put people off getting out of their cars. What seems entirely predictable and controllable on screen has unexpected results when translated into reality.","<b>E</b>","The same is true in transport engineering, which uses models to predict and shape the way <b>people move</b> through the city. Again, these models are necessary, but they are built on specific world views in which certain forms of efficiency and safety are considered and other experience of the city ignored. Designs that seem logical in models appear counter-intuitive in the actual experience of their users. The guard rails that will be familiar to anyone who has attempted to cross a British road, for example, were an engineering solution to<b> pedestrian </b>safety based on models that<b> prioritise </b>the smooth flow of traffic. On wide major roads, they often guide<b> pedestrians </b>to specific crossing points and <b>slow down</b> their progress <b>across the road</b> by using staggered access points divide the crossing into two – <b>one for each</b> carriageway. In doing so they make crossings feel longer, introducing<b> psychological </b>barriers greatly impacting those that are the least mobile, and encouraging others to make dangerous crossings to get around the guard rails. These barriers don’t <b>just make</b> it harder to cross the road: they divide communities and decrease<b> opportunities </b>for healthy transport. As a result, many are now being removed, causing disruption, cost, and waste.","<b>F</b>","If their <b>designers had</b> had the tools to think with their bodies – like dancers – and imagine how these barriers would feel, there might have been a better solution. In order to bring about fundamental changes to the ways we use our cities, engineering will <b>need to develop</b> a richer understanding of why <b>people move</b> in certain ways, and how this movement affects them. Choreography may not seem an obvious choice for tackling this problem. Yet it shares with engineering the aim of designing patterns of movement within limitations of space. It is an <b>art form</b> developed almost entirely by trying out ideas with the body, and gaining instant feedback on how the results feel.<b> Choreographers </b>have deep understanding of the psychological, aesthetic, and physical implications of <b>different ways</b> of moving.","<b>G</b>","Observing the choreographer Wayne McGregor, cognitive <b>scientist David</b> Kirsh described how he ‘thinks with the body’, Kirsh argues that by using the body to simulate outcomes, McGregor is able to imagine solutions that would not be possible using purely abstract thought. This kind of physical knowledge is valued in m<b>any areas</b> of expertise, but currently <b>has no</b> place in formal engineering design processes. A suggested method for transport engineers is to improvise design solutions and instant feedback about how they would work from their <b>own experience</b> of them, or model designs at full scale in the way<b> choreographers </b>experiment with groups of dancers. Above all, perhaps, they might learn to design for emotional as well as functional effects."]},{"name":"ARE/15-2-2","paragraph":["Should we try to bring <b>extinct species</b> <b>back to life</b>?","<b>A</b>","The passenger<b> pigeon </b>was a legendary species. Flying in vast numbers across <b>North America</b>, with potentially <b>many millions</b> within a single flock, their migration was once one of nature’s great spectacles. Sadly, the passenger pigeon’s existence came to an end on 1 September 1914, when the last living<b> specimen </b>died at Cincinnati Zoo. Geneticist Ben Novak is <b>lead researcher</b> on an ambitious project which now aims to bring the bird <b>back to life</b> through a process known as ‘de-extinction’. The basic premise involves using cloning technology to turn the DNA of extinct animals into a<b> fertilised </b>embryo, which is carried by the nearest relative still in existence – in this case, the abundant band-tailed<b> pigeon </b>– before being born as a living, breathing animal. <b>Passenger pigeons</b> are one of the pioneering<b> species </b>in this field, but they are far from the <b><b>only one</b>s</b> on which this cutting-edge technology is being trialled.","<b>B</b>","In Australia, the thylacine, more <b>commonly known</b> as the Tasmanian tiger, is another extinct creature which genetic scientists are striving to bring <b>back to life</b>. ‘There is no carnivore now in Tasmania that fills the<b> niche </b>which<b> thylacines </b>once occupied,’ explains Michael Archer of the University of New South Wales. He points out that in the decades since the<b> thylacine </b>went extinct, there has been a spread in a ‘dangerously debilitating’ facial tumour<b> syndrome </b>which threatens the existence of the Tasmanian devils, the island’s other notorious resident.<b> Thylacines </b>would have prevented this spread because they would have killed <b>significant number</b>s of Tasmanian devils. ‘If that<b> contagious </b>cancer had popped up previously, it would have burned out in whatever region it started. The return of<b> thylacines </b>to Tasmania could help to ensure that devils are never again subjected to risks of this kind.’","<b>C</b>","If <b>extinct species</b> can be brought <b>back to life</b>, can humanity begin to correct the damage it has caused to the <b>natural world</b> over the <b>past few</b> millennia? ‘The idea of de-extinction is that we can reverse this process, bringing<b> species </b>that <b>no longer</b> exist <b>back to life</b>,’ says Beth Shapiro of University of California Santa Cruz’s Genomics Institute. ‘I don’t think that we can do this. There is <b>no way</b> to <b>bring back</b> something that is 100 <b>per cent</b> identical to a<b> species </b>that went extinct a <b>long time</b> ago.’ A more practical approach for long-<b>extinct species</b> is to take the DNA of existing<b> species </b>as a template, ready for the insertion of<b> strands </b>of extinct animal DNA to create something new; a hybrid, based on the living species, but which looks and/or acts like the animal which died out.","<b>D</b>","This complicated process and questionable outcome begs the question: what is the actual point of this technology? ‘For us, the goal <b>has always</b> been replacing the <b>extinct species</b> with a suitable replacement,’ explains Novak. ‘When it comes to breeding, band-tailed<b> pigeons </b>scatter and make maybe <b>one or two</b> nests per hectare, whereas <b>passenger pigeons</b> were very<b> social </b>and would make 10,000 or more nests in one hectare.’ Since the disappearance of this key species, ecosystems in the eastern US have suffered, as the lack of<b> disturbance </b>caused by thousands of <b>passenger pigeons</b> wrecking trees and branches means there has been minimal need for regrowth. This has left forests stagnant and therefore unwelcoming to the plants and animals which evolved to help<b> regenerate </b>the forest after a disturbance. According to Novak, a hybridized band-tailed pigeon, with the added nesting habits of a passenger pigeon, could, in theory, re-establish that forest disturbance, thereby creating a habitat necessary for a <b>great many</b> other native<b> species </b>to thrive.","<b>E</b>","<b>Another popular</b> candidate for this technology is the <b>woolly mammoth</b>. George Church, professor at Harvard <b>Medical School</b> and leader of the <b>Woolly Mammoth</b><b> Revival </b>Project, has been focusing on cold resistance, the <b>main way</b> in which the extinct <b>woolly mammoth</b> and its nearest living relative, the Asian elephant, differ. By pinpointing which genetic traits <b>made it possible</b> for<b> mammoths </b>to survive the icy climate of the tundra, the project’s goal is to return mammoths, or a mammoth-like species, to the area. ‘My highest priority would be<b> preserving </b>the endangered Asian elephant,’ says Church, ‘expanding their range to the huge ecosystem of the tundra. Necessary adaptations would include smaller ears, thicker hair, and extra<b> insulating </b>fat, all for the purpose of reducing heat loss in the tundra, and all traits found in the now extinct <b>woolly mammoth</b>.’ This repopulation of the<b> tundra </b>and boreal forests of Eurasia and <b>North America</b> with large mammals could also be a useful factor in reducing <b>carbon emissions</b> – elephants<b> punch </b>holes through snow and knock down trees, which <b>encourages grass</b> growth. This grass growth would reduce temperature, and mitigate<b> emissions </b>from melting permafrost.","<b>F</b>","While the prospect of bringing extinct animals <b>back to life</b> might capture imaginations, it is, of course, far easier to try to save an existing<b> species </b>which is merely<b> threatened </b>with extinction. ‘Many of the technologies that people <b>have in mind</b> when they think about de-extinction can be used as a form of “genetic rescue”,’ explains Shapiro. She<b> prefers </b>to focus the debate on how this emerging technology could be used to <b>fully understand</b> why various<b> species </b>went extinct in the <b>first place</b>, and therefore how we could use it to make genetic modifications which could prevent mass extinctions in the future. ‘I would also say there’s an incredible moral<b> hazard </b>to not <b><b>do any</b>thing</b> at all,’ she continues. ‘We know that what we are doing today is not enough, and we have to be willing to <b>take some</b> calculated and measured risks.’"]},{"name":"ARE/15-2-3","paragraph":["<h2>Having a laugh</h2>","The findings of<b> psychological </b>scientists reveal the importance of humour","Humans start developing a sense of humour as early as <b>six weeks</b> old, when babies begin to laugh and smile in response to stimuli.<b> Laughter </b>is universal <b>across all</b> <b>human cultures</b> and even exists in some form in rats, chimps, and bonobos. <b>Like other</b> human emotions and expressions,<b> laughter </b>and humour<b> psychological </b>scientists with rich resources for studying human psychology, ranging from the development of language to the<b> neuroscience </b>of<b> social </b>perception.","Theories focusing on the evolution of<b> laughter </b>point to it as an important adaptation for<b> social </b>communication. Take, for example, the recorded<b> laughter </b>in TV comedy shows. Back in 1950, US sound engineer Charley Douglass hated dealing with the unpredictable<b> laughter </b>of live audiences, so started recording his own ‘laugh tracks’. These were intended to <b>help people</b> at home <b>feel like</b> they were in a<b> social </b>situation, such as a crowded theatre. Douglass even recorded various types of laughter, as well as mixtures of laugher from men, women, and children. In doing so, he <b>picked up</b> on a quality of<b> laughter </b>that is now interesting researchers: a simple ‘haha’ communicates a remarkable amount of<b> socially </b><b>relevant information</b>.","In <b>one study</b> conducted in 2016, samples of<b> laughter </b>from pairs of English-speaking students were recorded at the University of California, Santa Cruz. A <b>team made</b> up of more than 30<b> psychological </b>scientists, anthropologists, and biologists then played these recording to listeners from 24 diverse societies, from<b> indigenous </b>tribes in <b>New Guinea</b> to city-dwellers in India and Europe. Participants were asked whether they thought the people laughing were friends or strangers. On average, the results were remarkably consistent: worldwide, people’s guesses were correct approximately 60% of the time.","<b>Researchers have</b> <b>also found</b> that <b>different types</b> of<b> laughter </b>serve as codes to complex human<b> social </b>hierarchies. A <b>team led</b> by Christopher Oveis from the University of California, San Diego, found that high-status individuals <b>had different</b> laughs from low-status individuals, and that strangers’ judgements of an individual’s <b>social status</b> were influenced by the<b> dominant </b>or<b> submissive </b>quality of their laughter. In their study, 48 male <b>college students</b> were randomly assigned to groups of four, with <b>each group</b> composed of two low-status members, who had just joined their college fraternity group, and two high-status members, older student took a turn at being teased by the others, involving the use of<b> mildly </b>insulting nicknames. Analysis revealed that, as expected, high-status individuals produced more <b>dominant laughs</b> and fewer <b>submissive laughs</b> relative to the low-status individuals. Meanwhile, low-status individuals were more <b>likely to change</b> their<b> laughter </b>based on their position of power; that is, the newcomers produced more <b>dominant laughs</b> when they were in the ‘powerful’ role of teasers.<b> Dominant </b>laughter was higher in pitch, louder, and more variable in tone than<b> submissive </b>laughter.","<b>A </b> random group of volunteers then listened to an equal number of<b> dominant </b>and <b>submissive laughs</b> from both the high- and low-status individuals, and were asked to<b> estimate </b>the <b>social status</b> of the laughter. In line with predictions,<b> laughers </b>producing <b>dominant laughs</b> were perceived to be significantly higher in status than<b> laughers </b>producing <b>submissive laughs</b>. ‘This was particularly true for low-status individuals, who were rated as significantly higher in status when displaying a<b> dominant </b>versus<b> submissive </b>laugh,’ Oveis and colleagues note. ‘Thus, by strategically displaying more<b> dominant </b>laughter when the context allows, low-status individuals may achieve higher status in the eyes of others.’ However, high-status individuals were rated as high-status whether they produced their natural<b> dominant </b>laugh or tried to do a<b> submissive </b>one.","<b>Another study</b>, conducted by David Cheng and Lu Wang of <b>Australian National</b> University, was based on the<b> hypothesis </b>that humour might provide a<b> respite </b>from tedious situations in the workplace. This ‘mental break’ might<b> facilitate </b>the replenishment of mental resources. To test this theory, the researchers recruited 74 business students, ostensibly for an experiment on perception. First, the students performed a tedious task in which they had to cross out every instance of the letter ‘e’ over two pages of text. The students then were randomly assigned to watch a <b>video clip</b> eliciting either humour, contentment, or<b> neutral </b>feelings. Some watched a clip of the BBC comedy Mr. Bean, others a relaxing<b> scene </b>with dolphins swimming in the ocean, and others a<b> factual </b>video about the management profession.","The students then completed a task requiring persistence in which they were asked to guess the potential performance of employees based on provided profiles, and were told that making 10 correct assessments in a row would lead to a win. However, the software was programmed such that is was nearly impossible to achieve 10 consecutive correct answers. Participants were allowed to quit the task at any point.

He was the seventh child of Raymond Moore and his wife Mary Baker. He studied at Castleford Grammar School from 1909 to 1915, where his early interest in art was encouraged by his teacher Alice Gostick. After leaving school, Moore hoped to become a sculptor, but instead he complied with his father’s wish that he train as a schoolteacher. He had to abandon his training in 1917 when he was sent to France to fight in the <b><b>First World</b> War</b>.","After the war, Moore enrolled at the Leeds School of Art, where he studied for <b>two years</b>. In his first year, he spent most of his time drawing. Although he wanted to study sculpture, no teacher was appointed until his <b>second year</b>. At the end of that year, he passed the<b> sculpture </b>examination and was awarded a scholarship to the Royal College of Art in London. In September 1921, he moved to London and began <b>three years</b> of advanced study in sculpture.","Alongside the instruction he received at the Royal College, Moore visited many of the London museums, particularly the British Museum, which had a wide-ranging collection of ancient sculpture. During these visits, he discovered the power and beauty of <b>ancient Egypt</b>ian and African sculpture. As he became increasingly interested in these ‘primitive’ forms of art, he turned away from European sculptural traditions.","After graduating, Moore spent the first <b>six months</b> of 1925 travelling in France. When he visited the Trocadero Museum in Paris, he was impressed by a cast of a Mayan*<b> sculpture </b>of the rain spirit. It was a male<b> reclining </b>figure with its knees <b>drawn up</b> together, and its head at a right angle to its body. Moore became fascinated with this stone sculpture, which he thought had a power and originality that <b>no other</b> stone<b> sculpture </b>possessed. He himself started carving a variety of subjects in stone, including depiction of<b> reclining </b>women, mother-and-child groups, and masks.","Moore’s exceptional talent soon gained recognition, and in 1926 he started work as a<b> sculpture </b>instructor at the Royal College. In 1933, he became a member of a <b>group of young</b> artists called Unit One. The aim of the group was to convince the English public of the merits of the emerging international movement in modern art and architecture.","Around this time, Moore moved away from the human figure to experiment with abstract shapes. In 1931, he held an exhibition at the Leicester Galleries in London. His work was<b> enthusiastically </b>welcomed by fellow sculptors, but the reviews in the press were extremely negative and turned Moore into a notorious figure. There were calls for his resignation from the Royal College, and the following year, when his contract expired, he left to start a<b> sculpture </b>department at the Chelsea School of Art in London.","Throughout the 1930s, Moore did not <b>show any</b><b> inclination </b>to please the British public. He <b>became interested</b> in the paintings of the Spanish artist Pablo Picasso, whose work inspired him to distort the human body in a<b> radical </b>way. At times, he seemed to abandon the human figure altogether. The pages of his sketchbooks from this period show his ideas for abstract<b> sculptures </b>that bore little<b> resemblance </b>to the human form.","In 1940, during the <b>Second World</b> War, Moore stopped teaching at the Chelsea School and moved to a farmhouse about 20 miles north of London. A shortage of materials <b>forced him</b> to focus on drawing. He did<b> numerous </b>small sketches of Londoners, later turning these ideas into large coloured drawings in his studio. In 1942, he returned to Castleford to make a series of sketches of the miners who worked there.","In 1944, Harlow, a town near London, offered Moore a<b> commission </b>for a<b> sculpture </b>depicting a family. The resulting work signifies a dramatic change in Moore’s style, away from the experimentation of the 1930s towards a more natural and humanistic <b>subject matter</b>. He did dozens of studies in clay for the sculpture, and these were cast in bronze and issued in editions of seven to nine copies each. In this way, Moore’s work <b>became available</b> to collectors <b>all over the world</b>. The boost to his income enabled him to take on ambitious projects and start working on the scale he felt his<b> sculpture </b>demanded.","Critics who had begun to think that Moore <b>had become</b> less<b> revolutionary </b>were proven wrong by the appearance, in 1950, of the first of Moore’s series of standing figures in bronze, with their harsh and angular pierced forms and distinct impression of menace. Moore also varied his <b>subject matter</b> in the 1950s with such works as Warrior with Shield and Falling Warrior. These were rare examples of Moore’s use of the male figure and owe something to his visit to Greece in 1951, when he had the opportunity to study ancient <b>works of art</b>.","In his <b>final year</b>s, Moore created the <b>Henry Moore</b> Foundation to promote art appreciation and to display his work.

In the story of <b><b><b>Little Red</b> Riding</b> Hood</b> that European children are familiar with, a <b>young girl</b> on the way to see her grandmother meets a wolf and tells him where she is going. The wolf runs on ahead and disposes of the grandmother, then gets into bed dressed in the grandmother’s clothes to wait for <b><b><b>Little Red</b> Riding</b> Hood</b>. You may think you know the story – but which version? In some versions, the wolf swallows up the grandmother, while in others it locks her in a cupboard. In some stories <b>Red <b>Riding Hood</b></b> gets the better of the wolf on her own, while in others a hunter or a woodcutter hears her cries and comes to her rescue.","The universal<b> appeal </b>of these tales is frequently attributed to the idea that they contain<b> cautionary </b>messages: in the case of <b><b><b>Little Red</b> Riding</b> Hood</b>, to listen to your mother, and avoid talking to strangers. ‘It might be what we find interesting about this story is that it’s got this survival-<b>relevant information</b> in it,’ says anthropologist Jamie Tehrani at Durham <b>University in the UK</b>. But his <b>research suggests</b> otherwise. ‘We have this huge gap in our knowledge about the history and prehistory of storytelling, <b>despite the fact</b> that we know this<b> genre </b>is an incredibly ancient one,’ he says. That hasn’t stopped anthropologists, folklorists* and other academics devising theories to explain the importance of <b>fairy tales</b> in human society. Now <b>Tehrani has</b> found a way to test these ideas, borrowing a technique from evolutionary biologists.","To work out the evolutionary history, development and relationships among groups of organisms, biologists compare the characteristics of living<b> species </b>in a process called ‘phylogenetic analysis’. <b>Tehrani has</b> used the <b>same approach</b> to compare related versions of <b>fairy tales</b> to discover how they <b>have evolved</b> and which elements have survived longest.","Tehrani’s analysis focused on <b><b><b>Little Red</b> Riding</b> Hood</b> in its many forms, which include another Western fairy tale known as The Wolf and the Kids. Checking for variants of these two tales and similar stories from Africa, East Asia and other regions, he <b>ended up</b> with 58 stories recorded from oral traditions. Once his phylogenetic analysis had established that they were indeed related, he used the same methods to explore how they <b>have developed</b> and altered over time.","First he tested some assumptions about which aspects of the story alter least as it evolves, indicating their importance. Folklorists believe that what happens in a story is more <b>central to the story</b> than the characters in it – that visiting a relative, only to be met by a<b> scary </b>animal in disguise, is more fundamental than whether the visitor is a little girl or three siblings, or the animal is a tiger instead of a wolf.","However, Tehrani found no significant difference in the rate of evolution of incidents compared with that of characters. ‘Certain episodes are very stable because they are crucial to the story, but there are <b>lots of other</b> details that can evolve quite freely,’ he says. Neither did his analysis support the theory that the central section of a story is the most conserved part. He found no significant difference in the flexibility of events there compared with the beginning or the end.","But the <b>really big</b> surprise came when he looked at the<b> cautionary </b>elements of the story. ‘Studies on hunter-gatherer folk tales suggest that these narratives include <b>really important</b> information about the environment and the possible dangers that may be faced there – stuff that’s<b> relevant </b>to survival,’ he says. Yet in his analysis such elements were just as flexible as seemingly trivial details. What, then, is important enough to be reproduced from generation to generation?","The answer, it would appear, is fear – blood-thirsty and<b> gruesome </b>aspects of the story, such as the eating of the grandmother by the wolf, turned out to be the best<b> preserved </b>of all. Why are these details retained by generations of storytellers, when other features are not? <b>Tehrani has</b> an idea: ‘In an oral context, a story won’t survive because of one great teller. It <b><b>also need</b>s</b> to be interesting when it’s told by someone who’s not necessarily a great storyteller.’ Maybe being swallowed whole by a wolf, then cut out of its stomach alive is so gripping that it helps the story remain popular, <b>no matter</b> how badly it’s told.","Jack Zipes at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, is unconvinced by Tehrani’s views on <b>fairy tales</b>. ‘Even if they’re gruesome, they won’t<b> stick </b>unless they matter,’ he says. He believes the perennial theme of women as victims in <b>stories like</b> <b><b><b>Little Red</b> Riding</b> Hood</b> explains why they continue to feel relevant. But Tehrani points out that although this is often the case in Western versions, it is not always true elsewhere. In Chinese and Japanese versions, often known as The Tiger Grandmother, the villain is a woman, and in both Iran and Nigeria, the victim is a boy.","Mathias Clasen at Aarhus University in Denmark isn’t surprised by Tehrani’s findings. ‘Habits and<b> morals </b>change, but the things that<b> scare </b>us, and the fact that we seek out entertainment that’s designed to<b> scare </b>us – those are constant,’ he says. Clasen believes that<b> scary </b>stories teach us what it feels like to be afraid without having to experience real danger, and so <b>build up</b><b> resistance </b>to <b>negative emotions</b>."]},{"name":"ARE/15-4-1","paragraph":["<h2>The return of the huarango</h2>","The<b> arid </b>valleys of southern Peru are welcoming the return of a native plant","The south coast of Peru is a narrow, 2,000-kilometre-long<b> strip </b>of<b> desert </b>squeezed between the Andes and the <b>Pacific Ocean</b>. It is also <b>one of the most</b> fragile ecosystems on Earth. It <b>hardly ever</b> rains there, and the only year-round source of water is located tens of <b>metres below the surface</b>. This is why the <b>huarango tree</b> is so suited to life there: it has the longest roots of any tree in the world. They stretch down 50-80 metres and, as well as <b>sucking up</b> water for the tree, they bring it into the higher subsoil, creating a <b>water source</b> for other plant life.","Dr David Beresford-Jones, archaeobotanist at Cambridge University, has been studying the role of the <b>huarango tree</b> in landscape change in the Lower <b>Ica Valley</b> in southern Peru. He believes the<b> huarango </b>was key to the <b>ancient people</b>’s diet and, because it could reach deep <b>water source</b>s, it allowed <b>local people</b> to<b> withstand </b>years of<b> drought </b>when their other crops failed. But over the centuries <b>huarango tree</b>s were <b>gradually replaced</b> with crops. <b>Cutting down</b> native woodland leads to erosion, as there is nothing to keep the soil in place. So when the<b> huarangos </b>go, the land turns into a desert. Nothing grows at all in the Lower <b>Ica Valley</b> now.","For centuries the <b>huarango tree</b> was vital to the people of the<b> neighbouring </b>Middle <b>Ica Valley</b> too. They grew vegetables under it and ate products made from its seed pods. Its leaves and bark were used for herbal remedies, while its branches were used for<b> charcoal </b>for cooking and heating, and its trunk was used to build houses. But now it is disappearing rapidly. The majority of the<b> huarango </b>forests in the valley <b>have already</b> been cleared for<b> fuel </b>and agriculture – initially, these were smallholdings, but now they’re huge farms producing crops for the international market.","‘Of the forests that were here 1,000 <b>years ago</b>, 99 <b>per cent</b> <b>have already</b> gone,’ says<b> botanist </b>Oliver Whaley from Kew Gardens in London, who, together with ethnobotanist Dr William Milliken, is running a pioneering project to protect and restore the rapidly disappearing habitat. In order to succeed, Whaley needs to get the <b>local people</b> on board, and that has meant overcoming local prejudices. ‘Increasingly aspirational communities think that if you plant food trees in your home or street, it shows you are poor, and still need to grow your own food,’ he says. In order to stop the Middle <b>Ica Valley</b> going the same way as the Lower <b>Ica Valley</b>, Whaley is encouraging locals to love the<b> huarangos </b>again. ‘It’s a process of cultural resuscitation,’ he says. He <b>has already</b> <b>set up</b> a<b> huarango </b>festival to reinstate a sense of pride in their eco-heritage, and <b>has helped</b> local<b> schoolchildren </b>plant thousands of trees.","‘In <b>order to get</b> people interested in habitat restoration, you need to plant a tree that is useful to them,’ says Whaley. So, he has been working with local families to attempt to create a<b> sustainable </b>income from the<b> huarangos </b>by turning their products into foodstuffs. ‘Boil up the beans and you get this thick brown<b> syrup </b>like molasses. You can <b>also use</b> it in drinks, soups or stews.’ The<b> pods </b>can be ground into flour to make cakes, and the seeds roasted into a sweet, chocolatey ‘coffee’. ‘It’s packed full of vitamins and minerals,’ Whaley says.","And some farmers are already planting huarangos. Alberto Benevides, owner of <b>Ica Valley</b>’s only certified organic farm, which Whaley helped <b>set up</b>, has been planting the tree for 13 years. He produces<b> syrup </b>and flour, and sells these products at an organic farmers’ market in Lima. His farm is <b>relatively small</b> and doesn’t yet provide him with enough to live on, but he hopes this will change. ‘The organic market is growing rapidly in Peru,’ Benevides says. ‘I am investing in the future.’","But even if Whaley can convince the <b>local people</b> to fall in love with the<b> huarango </b>again, there is still the threat of the larger farms. Some of these cut across the forests and break up the corridors that allow the essential movement of mammals, birds and<b> pollen </b><b>up and down</b> the narrow forest strip. In the hope of counteracting this, he’s persuading farmers to <b>let him</b> plant forest corridors on their land. He believes the extra woodland will also benefit the farms by reducing their water usage through a lowering of<b> evaporation </b>and providing a<b> refuge </b>for bio-control insects.","‘If we can record biodiversity and see how it all works, then we’re in a good position to move on from there. Desert<b> habitats </b>can reduce down to <b>very little</b>,’ Whaley explains. ‘It’s not like a rainforest that <b>needs to have</b> this huge expanse. Life <b>has always</b> been confined to corridors and islands here. If you just have a few trees left, the population can grow <b>up quickly</b> because it’s used to<b> exploiting </b>water when it arrives.’ He sees his project as a model that has the potential to be rolled out across other<b> arid </b>areas a<b>round the world</b>. ‘If we can do it here, in the most fragile system on Earth, then that’s a real message of hope for lots of places, including Africa, where there is<b> drought </b>and they just can’t afford to wait for rain.’"]},{"name":"ARE/15-4-2","paragraph":["<b>Silbo Gomero</b> – the<b> whistle </b>‘language’ of the Canary Islands","La Gomera is one of the Canary Islands situated in the Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of Africa. This small<b> volcanic </b>island is mountainous, with<b> steep </b>rocky<b> slopes </b>and deep, wooded ravines, rising to 1,487 metres at its highest peak. It is <b>also home</b> to the <b>best known</b> of the world’s<b> whistle </b>‘languages’, a means of transmitting information over <b>long distances</b> which is perfectly adapted to the extreme<b> terrain </b>of the island.","This ‘language’, known as ‘Silbo’ or ‘<b>Silbo Gomero</b>’ – from the Spanish word for ‘whistle’ – is now shedding light on the language-processing abilities of the human brain, according to scientists. <b>Researchers say</b> that Silbo activates parts of the brain normally associated with spoken language, suggesting that the brain is remarkably flexible in its ability to<b> interpret </b>sounds as language.","‘Science has <b>developed the idea</b> of <b>brain areas</b> that are dedicated to language, and we are starting to understand the scope of signals that can be recognised as language,’ says David Corina, co-author of a recent study and associate <b>professor of <b>psychology at the University</b></b> of Washington in Seattle.","Silbo is a<b> substitute </b>for Spanish, with individual words recoded into<b> whistles </b>which have high- and low-frequency tones. A whistler – or silbador – puts a finger in his or her mouth to increase the whistle’s pitch, while the other hand can be cupped to adjust the direction of the sound. ‘There is much more ambiguity in the<b> whistled </b>signal than in the spoken signal,’ explains <b>lead researcher</b> Manuel Carreiras,<b> psychology </b>professor at the University of La Laguna on the Canary island of Tenerife. Because<b> whistled </b>‘words’ can be hard to distinguish,<b> silbadores </b>rely on repetition, as well as awareness of context, to <b>make themselves</b> understood.","The<b> silbadores </b>of Gomera are traditionally<b> shepherds </b>and other isolated mountain folk, and their novel means of staying in touch allows them to communicate over distances of up to 10 kilometres. Carreiras explains that<b> silbadores </b>are able to pass a surprising <b>amount of information</b> via their whistles. ‘In daily life they use<b> whistles </b>to communicate short commands, but any Spanish sentence could be whistled.’ Silbo <b>has proved</b> <b>particularly useful</b> when fires have<b> occurred </b>on the island and rapid communication across <b>large areas</b> has been vital.","The study team used neuroimaging equipment to contrast the brain activity of<b> silbadores </b>while listening to<b> whistled </b>and spoken Spanish. Results showed the left<b> temporal </b>lobe of the brain, which is usually associated with spoken language, was engaged during the processing of Silbo. The researchers found that other key regions in the brain’s frontal<b> lobe </b>also responded to the whistles, including those activated in response to sign language among deaf people. When the experiments were repeated with non-whistlers, however, activation was observed in all areas of the brain.","‘Our results provide more evidence about the flexibility of human capacity for language in a variety of forms,’ Corina says. ‘These data suggest that left-hemisphere language regions are uniquely adapted for communicative purposes, independent of the modality of signal. The non-Silbo speakers were not recognising Silbo as a language. They <b>had no</b>thing to grab onto, so multiple areas of their brains were activated.’","Carreiras says the origins of <b>Silbo Gomero</b> remain obscure, but that<b> indigenous </b>Canary Islanders, who were of North African origin, <b>already had</b> a<b> whistled </b>language when Spain<b> conquered </b>the<b> volcanic </b>islands in the 15th century. <b>Whistled languages</b> survive today in Papua <b>New Guinea</b>, Mexico, Vietnam, Guyana, China, Nepal, Senegal, and a few<b> mountainous </b>pockets in southern Europe. There are thought to be as many as 70 <b>whistled languages</b> still in use, though only 12 have been described and studied scientifically. This <b>form of communication</b> is an adaptation found among cultures where people are often isolated from <b>each other</b>, according to Julien Meyer, a researcher at the Institute of Human Sciences in Lyon, France. ‘They are mostly used in mountains or dense forests,’ he says. ‘<b>Whistled languages</b> are quite clearly defined and represent an original adaptation of the spoken language for the needs of isolated human groups.’","But with modern communication technology now widely available, <b>researchers say</b> <b>whistled languages</b> like Silbo are<b> threatened </b>with extinction. With<b> dwindling </b>numbers of Gomera islanders still fluent in the language, Canaries’ authorities are taking steps to try to ensure its survival. Since 1999, <b>Silbo Gomero</b> has been taught in all of the island’s elementary schools. In addition, locals are seeking assistance from the <b>United Nations</b> Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). ‘The local authorities are <b>trying to get</b> an award from the organisation to declare [<b>Silbo Gomero</b>] as something that should be<b> preserved </b>for humanity,’ Carreiras adds."]},{"name":"ARE/15-4-3","paragraph":["<h2>Environmental practices of big businesses</h2>","The <b>environmental practices</b> of <b><b>big business</b>es</b> are shaped by a fundamental fact that for many of us offend our sense of justice. Depending on the circumstances, a business may maximize the <b>amount of money</b> it makes, at least in the short term, by damaging the environment and hurting people. That is still the case today for fishermen in an unmanaged fishery without quotas, and for international <b>logging companies</b> with short-term leases on <b>tropical rainforest</b> land in places with corrupt officials and unsophisticated landowners. When <b>government regulation</b> is effective, and when the public is environmentally aware, environmentally clean <b><b>big business</b>es</b> may out-compete dirty ones, but the reverse is likely to be true if <b>government regulation</b> is<b> ineffective </b>and if the public doesn’t care.","It is easy for the rest of us to blame a business for helping itself by hurting <b>other people</b>. But blaming alone is unlikely to produce change. It ignores the fact that businesses are not charities but profit-making companies, and that publicly owned companies with shareholders are under obligation to those shareholders to maximize profits, provided that they do so by legal means. US laws make a company’s directors legally liable for something termed ‘breach of fiduciary responsibility’ if they knowingly manage a company in a way that reduces profits. The car manufacturer Henry Ford was in fact successfully sued by shareholders in 1919 for raising the <b>minimum wage</b> of his workers to $5 per day: the courts declared that, while Ford’s<b> humanitarian </b>sentiments about his employees were nice, his business existed to make profits for its stockholders.","Our blaming of businesses also ignores the <b>ultimate responsibility</b> of the public for creating the condition that let a business profit through destructive environmental policies. In the <b>long run</b>, it is the public, either directly or through its politicians, that <b>has the power</b> to make such destructive policies unprofitable and illegal, and to make<b> sustainable </b>environmental policies profitable.","The public can do that by suing businesses for harming them, as happened after the Exxon Valdez disaster, in which over 40,000m3 of oil were<b> spilled </b>off the coast of Alaska. The public may <b>also make</b> their opinion felt by<b> preferring </b>to buy sustainably harvested products; by making employees of companies with poor track records feel ashamed of their company and complain to their own management; by<b> preferring </b>their governments to award valuable contracts to businesses with a good environmental track record; and by pressing their governments to pass and enforce laws and regulations requiring good <b>environmental practices</b>.","In turn, <b><b>big business</b>es</b> can expert powerful pressure on any suppliers that might ignore public or government pressure. For instance, after the US public became concerned about the spread of a <b>disease known</b> as BSE, which was<b> transmitted </b>to humans through infected meat, the US government’s Food and Drug Administration introduced rules demanding that the meat industry abandon practices associated with the risk of the disease spreading. But for <b>five years</b> the meat packers refused to follow these, claiming that they would be <b>too expensive</b> to obey. However, when a major fast-food company then made the same demands after customer purchases of its hamburgers plummeted, the meat industry complied within weeks. The public’s task is therefore to identify which links in the supply chain are sensitive to public pressure: for instance, fast-food chains or jewelry stores, but not meat packers or gold miners.","Some readers may be disappointed or<b> outraged </b>that I place the <b>ultimate responsibility</b> for business practices harming the public on the public itself. I also believe that the public must accept the<b> necessity </b>for higher prices for products to cover the added costs, if any, of sound <b>environmental practices</b>. My views may seem to ignore the belief that businesses should act in accordance with moral<b> principles </b>even if this leads to a<b> reduction </b>in their profits. But I <b>think we have</b> to recognize that, throughout <b>human history</b>, in all politically complex human societies, <b>government regulation</b> has arisen <b>precisely because</b> it was found that not only did moral<b> principles </b>need to be made explicit, they <b>also need</b>ed to be enforced.","To me, the conclusion that the public has the <b>ultimate responsibility</b> for the behavior of even the biggest businesses is empowering and hopeful, rather than disappointing. My conclusion is not a moralistic one about who is right or wrong, admirable or selfish, a good guy or a bad guy. In the past, businesses <b>have changed</b> when the public came to expect and require different behavior, to reward businesses for behavior that the public wanted, and to make things difficult for businesses practicing behaviors that the public didn’t want. I predict that in the future, just as in the past, changes in public attitudes will be essential for changes in businesses’ <b>environmental practices</b>."]},{"name":"ARE/16-1-1","paragraph":["<h2>Reading Passage</h2>","<b><b>Polar bear</b>s</b> are being increasingly<b> threatened </b>by the effects of <b>climate change</b>, but their disappearance could have far-reaching consequences. They are uniquely adapted to the <b>extreme conditions</b> of the Arctic Circle, where<b> temperatures </b>can reach -40°C. <b>One reason</b> for this is that they have up to 11 centimetres of fat underneath their skin. Humans with comparative levels of adipose tissue would be considered obese and would be likely to suffer from<b> diabetes </b>and <b>heart disease</b>. Yet the <b>polar bear</b> experiences no such consequences.","<b>A </b> 2014 study by Shi Ping Liu and colleagues<b> sheds </b>light on this mystery. They compared the genetic structure of <b><b>polar bear</b>s</b> with that of their closest relatives from a warmer climate, the <b>brown bears</b>. This allowed them to determine the genes that <b><b>have all</b>owed</b> <b><b>polar bear</b>s</b> to survive in one of the toughest environments on Earth. Liu and his colleagues found the <b><b>polar bear</b>s</b> had a gene known as APoB, which reduces levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) – a form of ‘bad’ cholesterol. In humans,<b> mutations </b>of this gene are associated with increased risk of <b>heart disease</b>. <b><b>Polar bear</b>s</b> may therefore be an important study model to understand <b>heart disease</b> in humans.","The genome of the <b>polar bear</b> may <b>also provide</b> the solution for another condition, one that particularly affects our older generation: osteoporosis. This is a disease where bones show reduced density, usually caused by insufficient exercise, reduced calcium intake or food starvation. Bone tissue is constantly being remodelled, meaning that bone is added or removed, depending on nutrient availability and the stress that the bone is under. Female <b><b>polar bear</b>s</b>, however, undergo <b>extreme conditions</b> during every pregnancy. Once autumn comes around, these females will dig<b> maternity </b>dens in the snow and will remain there throughout the winter, <b>both before and after the birth</b> of their cubs. This process results in about <b>six months</b> of fasting, where the female <b>bears have</b> to keep themselves and their cubs alive, depleting their own calcium and calorie reserves. Despite this, their bones remain strong and dense.","Physiologists Alanda Lennox and Allen Goodship found an explanation for this<b> paradox </b>in 2008. They discovered that pregnant <b>bears were able</b> to increase the density of their bones before they started to build their dens. In addition, <b>six months</b> later, when they finally emerged from the den with their cubs, there was <b>no evidence</b> of significant loss of bone density. Hibernating <b>brown bears</b> <b>do not have</b> this capacity and must therefore<b> resort </b>to major bone reformation in the following spring. If the mechanism of bone remodelling in <b><b>polar bear</b>s</b> can be understood, many bedridden humans, and even astronauts, could potentially benefit.","The medical benefits of the <b>polar bear</b> for humanity <b>certainly have</b> their importance in our conservation efforts, but these should not be the only factors taken into consideration. We tend to <b>want to protect</b> animals we think are intelligent and possess emotions, such as elephants and primates. Bears, on the other hand, seem to be perceived as stupid and in many cases violent. And yet anecdotal evidence from the field challenges those assumptions, suggesting for example that <b><b>polar bear</b>s</b> have good problem-solving abilities. A male bear called GoGo in Tennoji Zoo, Osaka, has even been observed <b>making use</b> of a tool to manipulate his environment. The bear used a tree branch on multiple occasions to dislodge a piece of meat hung out of his reach. Problem-solving ability <b>has also</b> been<b> witnessed </b>in wild <b><b>polar bear</b>s</b>, although not as obviously as with GoGo. A calculated move by a male bear involved running and jumping onto barrels in an attempt to get to a photographer standing on a platform four <b>metres high</b>.","In other studies, such as one by Alison Ames in 2008, <b><b>polar bear</b>s</b> showed deliberate and focused manipulation. For example, Ames observed bears putting objects in piles and then knocking them over in what appeared to be a game. The study demonstrates that bears are capable of agile and thought-out behaviours. These examples suggest <b>bears have</b> greater creativity and problem-solving abilities than <b>previously thought</b>.","As for emotions, while the evidence is <b>once again</b> anecdotal, many <b>bears have</b> been seen to hit out at ice and snow – seemingly out of<b> frustration </b>– when they have just missed out on a kill. Moreover, <b><b>polar bear</b>s</b> can form<b> unusual </b><b>relationships with other</b> species, including playing with the dogs used to pull<b> sleds </b>in the Arctic. Remarkably, one hand-raised <b>polar bear</b> called Agee has formed a close relationship with her owner Mark Dumas to the point where they even swim together. This is even more astonishing since <b><b>polar bear</b>s</b> are known to actively hunt humans in the wild.","If <b>climate change</b> were to lead to their extinction, this would mean not only the loss of potential breakthroughs in human medicine, but more importantly, the disappearance of an intelligent, majestic animal."]},{"name":"ARE/16-1-2","paragraph":["<h2>The Step Pyramid of Djoser</h2>","<b>A</b>","The<b> pyramids </b>are the <b>most famous</b> monuments of <b>ancient Egypt</b> and still hold enormous interest for people in the <b>present day</b>. These grand,<b> impressive </b>tributes to the memory of the Egyptian kings <b>have become</b> linked with the country <b>even though</b> other cultures, such as the Chinese and Mayan, also built pyramids. The evolution of the<b> pyramid </b>form has been written and argued about for centuries. However, there is no question that, as far as Egypt is concerned, it began with one monument to one king designed by one brilliant architect: the <b>Step Pyramid</b> of Djoser at Saqqara.","<b>B</b>","Djoser was the first king of the Third Dynasty of Egypt and the first to build in stone. Prior to Djoser’s reign, tombs were rectangular monuments made of<b> dried </b>clay brick, which covered underground passages where the deceased person was buried. For reasons which remain unclear, Djoser’s main official, whose name was Imhotep,<b> conceived </b>of building a taller, more<b> impressive </b>tomb for his king by stacking stone slabs on top of <b>one another</b>,<b> progressively </b>making them smaller, to form the shape <b>now known</b> as the <b>Step Pyramid</b>. Djoser is <b>thought to have</b> reigned for 19 years, but some historians and scholars attribute a much longer time for his rule, owing to the number and size of the monuments he built.","<b>C</b>","The <b>Step Pyramid</b> has been thoroughly examined and investigated over the last century, and it is <b>now known</b> that the building process went through many <b>different stages</b>. Historian Marc Van de Mieroop comments on this, writing ‘Much experimentation was involved, which is especially clear in the construction of the<b> pyramid </b>in the center of the complex. It had several plans … before it became the first <b>Step Pyramid</b> in history, piling six levels on top of <b>one another</b> … The weight of the enormous mass was a challenge for the builders, who placed the stones at an inward incline in <b>order to prevent</b> the monument breaking up.’","<b>D</b>","When finally completed, the <b>Step Pyramid</b> rose 62 meters high and was the tallest structure of its time. The complex in which it was built was the size of a city in <b>ancient Egypt</b> and included a temple, courtyards, shrines, and living<b> quarters </b>for the priests. It covered a region of 16<b> hectares </b>and was surrounded by a wall 10.5 meters high. The w<b>all had</b> 13 false doors cut into it with <b>only one</b> true entrance cut into the south-east corner; the entire wall was then ringed by a trench 750 meters long and 40 meters wide. The false doors and the trench were<b> incorporated </b>into the complex to discourage unwanted visitors. If someone wished to enter, he or she would have <b>needed to know</b> in advance how to find the location of the true opening in the wall. Djoser was so proud of his accomplishment that he broke the tradition of having only his own name on the monument and had Imhotep’s name carved on it as well.","<b>E</b>","The<b> burial </b>chamber of the tomb, where the king’s body was<b> laid </b>to rest, was dug beneath the base of the pyramid, surrounded by a vast<b> maze </b>of long<b> tunnels </b>that had rooms off them to discourage robbers. <b>One of the most</b><b> mysterious </b>discoveries found inside the<b> pyramid </b>was a <b>large number</b> of stone vessels. Over 40,000 of these vessels, of various forms and shapes, were discovered in<b> storerooms </b>off the pyramid’s underground passages. They are inscribed with the names of rulers from the First and Second Dynasties of Egypt and made from <b>different kinds</b> of stone. There is no agreement among scholars and archaeologists on why the<b> vessels </b>were placed in the tomb of Djoser or what they were supposed to represent. The archaeologist Jean-Philippe Lauer, who<b> excavated </b>most of the<b> pyramid </b>and complex, believes they were originally stored and then give a ‘proper burial’ by Djoser in his<b> pyramid </b>to honor his predecessors.

Automation – or ‘embodied artificial intelligence’ (AI) – is one aspect of the<b> disruptive </b>effects of technology on the<b> labour </b>market. ‘Disembodied AI’, like the algorithms running in our smartphones, is another.","Dr Stella Pachidi from Cambridge Judge <b>Business School</b> believes that <b>some of the most</b> fundamental changes are happening as a result of the ‘algorithmication’ of jobs that are dependent on <b>data rather</b> than on production – the so-called knowledge economy. Algorithms are capable of learning from data to undertake tasks that previously needed human judgement, such as reading legal contracts, analysing medical scans and gathering market intelligence.","‘In many cases, they can outperform humans,’ says Pachidi. ‘Organisations are attracted to using algorithms because they <b>want to make</b> choices based on what they consider is “perfect information”, as well as to reduce costs and enhance productivity.’","‘But these enhancements are not without consequences,’ says Pachidi. ‘If routine <b>cognitive tasks</b> are taken over by AI, how do professions develop their future experts?’ she asks. ‘<b>One way</b> of learning about a job is “legitimate<b> peripheral </b>participation” – a<b> novice </b>stands next to experts and learns by observation. If this isn’t happening, then you <b>need to find</b> <b>new ways</b> to learn.’","Another issue is the extent to which the technology influences or even controls the workforce. For over <b>two years</b>, Pachidi monitored a telecommunications company. ‘The way telecoms salespeople work is through personal and frequent contact with clients, using the benefit of experience to assess a situation and reach a decision. However, the company had <b>started using</b> a(n) … algorithm that defined when account managers should contact certain customers about which kinds of campaigns and what to offer them.’","The algorithm – usually build by<b> external </b>designers – often becomes the keeper of knowledge, she explains. In cases like this, Pachidi believes, a short-sighted view begins to<b> creep </b>into working practices whereby workers learn through the ‘algorithm’s eyes’ and become dependent on its instructions. Alternative explorations – where experimentation and human instinct lead to progress and <b>new ideas</b> – are effectively discouraged.","Pachidi and colleagues even observed people developing strategies to make the algorithm work to their own advantage. ‘We are seeing cases where workers feed the algorithm with false data to reach their targets,’ she reports.","It’s<b> scenarios </b>like these that <b>many researchers</b> are working to avoid. Their objective is to make AI technologies more trustworthy and transparent, so that organisations and individuals understand how AI decisions are made. In the meantime, says Pachidi, ‘We <b><b>need to make</b> sure</b> we <b>fully understand</b> the dilemmas that this <b>new world</b> raises regarding expertise,<b> occupational </b>boundaries and control.’","Economist Professor Hamish Low believes that the <b>future of work</b> will involve major transitions across the whole life course for everyone: ‘The traditional trajectory of full-time education followed by full-time work followed by a pensioned retirement is a thing of the past,’ says Low. Instead, he envisages a multistage employment life: one where<b> retraining </b>happens across the life course, and where multiple jobs and no job happen by choice at <b>different stages</b>.","On the subject of job losses, Low believes the predictions are founded on a fallacy: ‘It assumes that the number of jobs is fixed. If in 30 years, half of 100 jobs are being carried out by robots, that doesn’t mean we are left with just 50 jobs for humans. The number of jobs will increase: we would expect there to be 150 jobs.’","Dr Ewan McGaughey, at Cambridge’s Centre for Business Research and King’s College London, agrees that ‘apocalyptic’ views about the <b>future of work</b> are misguided. ‘It’s the laws that restrict the supply of capital to the job market, not the<b> advent </b>of <b>new technologies</b> that causes unemployment.’","His recently published research answers the question of whether automation, AI and<b> robotics </b>will mean a ‘jobless future’ by looking at the causes of unemployment. ‘History is clear that change can mean redundancies. But<b> social </b>policies can<b> tackle </b>this through<b> retraining </b>and redeployment.’","He adds: ‘If there is going to be change to jobs as a result of AI and<b> robotics </b>then I’d <b>like to see</b> governments seizing the opportunity to improve policy to enforce good <b>job security</b>. We can “reprogramme” the law to prepare for a fairer <b>future of work</b> and leisure.’ McGaughey’s findings are a call to arms to leaders of organisations, governments and banks to pre-empt the coming changes with bold new policies that<b> guarantee </b>full employment, fair incomes and a thriving economic democracy.","‘The promises of these <b>new technologies</b> are astounding. They deliver humankind the capacity to live in a way that nobody could have once imagined,’ he adds. ‘Just as the <b>industrial revolution</b> brought people past<b> subsistence </b>agriculture, and the corporate revolution enabled mass production, a third revolution has been pronounced. But it will not only be one of technology. The next revolution will be social.’"]},{"name":"ARE/16-2-1","paragraph":["<h2>The White Horse of Uffington</h2>","The cutting of huge figures or ‘geoglyphs’ into the earth of English hillsides has <b>taken place</b> for more than 3,000 years. There are 56 <b>hill figures</b> scattered around England, with the <b>vast majority</b> on the chalk downlands of the country’s southern counties. The figures include giants, horses, crosses and regimental badges. Although the majority of these<b> geoglyphs </b>date within the last 300 years or so, there are <b>one or two</b> that are <b>much older</b>.","The <b>most famous</b> of these figures is perhaps also the most<b> mysterious </b>– the <b><b>Uffington White</b> Horse</b> in Oxfordshire. The <b>White Horse</b> <b>has recently</b> been re-dated and shown to be even older than its previously assigned ancient pre-Roman Iron Age* date. More<b> controversial </b>is the date of the<b> enigmatic </b>Long Man of Wilmington in Sussex. <b>While many</b> historians are convinced the figure is prehistoric, others believe that it was the work of an artistic monk from a nearby priory and was created between the 11th and 15th centuries.","The method of cutting these huge figures was simply to remove the overlying grass to reveal the gleaming white chalk below. However, the grass would soon grow over the<b> geoglyph </b>again unless it was regularly cleaned or<b> scoured </b>by a fairly large team of people. <b>One reason</b> that the <b>vast majority</b> of <b>hill figures</b> have disappeared is that when the traditions associated with the figures faded, people <b>no longer</b><b> bothered </b>or remembered to clear away the grass to expose the chalk outline. Furthermore, over <b>hundreds of years</b> the outlines would sometimes change due to people not always cutting in <b>exactly the same</b> place, thus creating a different shape to the original geoglyph. That fact that any ancient <b>hill figures</b> survive at all in England today is testament to the strength and continuity of local customs and beliefs which, in one case at least, must stretch back over millennia.","The <b><b>Uffington White</b> Horse</b> is a unique,<b> stylised </b>representation of a horse consisting of a long,<b> sleek </b>back, thin disjointed legs, a streaming tail, and a bird-like beaked head. The elegant creature almost melts into the landscape. The horse is situated 2.5 km from Uffington village on a<b> steep </b>close to the Late <b>Bronze Age</b>* (c. 7th <b>century BCE</b>)<b> hillfort </b>of Uffington<b> Castle </b>and below the Ridgeway, a long-distance Neolithic** track.","The Uffington Horse is also surrounded by <b>Bronze Age</b><b> burial </b>mounds. It is not far from the <b>Bronze Age</b><b> cemetery </b>of Lambourn Seven Barrows, which consists of more than 30 well-preserved<b> burial </b>mounds. The carving has been placed in such a way as to make it extremely difficult to see from close quarters, and <b>like many</b><b> geoglyphs </b>is best appreciated from the air. Nevertheless, there are certain areas of the Vale of the <b>White Horse</b>, the valley containing and named after the<b> enigmatic </b>creature, from which an adequate impression may be gained. Indeed on a clear day the carving can be seen from up to 30 km away.","The earliest evidence of a horse at Uffington is from the 1070s CE when ‘<b>White Horse</b> Hill’ is mentioned in documents from the nearby Abbey of Abingdon, and the first<b> reference </b>to the horse itself is soon after, in 1190 CE. However, the carving is believed to <b>date back</b> much further than that. Due to the similarity of the <b><b>Uffington White</b> Horse</b> to the<b> stylised </b>depictions of horses on 1st <b>century BCE</b> coins, it had been thought that the creature must also date to that period.","However, in 1995 Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) testing was carried out by the Oxford Archaeological Unit on soil from two of the lower layers of the horse’s body, and from another cut near the base. The result was a date for the horse’s construction somewhere between 1400 and 600 BCE – in other words, it had a Late <b>Bronze Age</b> or Early Iron Age origin.","The<b> latter </b>end of this date range would tie the carving of the horse in with<b> occupation </b>of the nearby Uffington hillfort, indicating that it may represent a tribal emblem making the land of the<b> inhabitants </b>of the hillfort. Alternatively, the carving may <b>have been carried</b> out during a Bronze or Iron Age ritual. <b>Some research</b>ers see the horse as representing the Celtic*** horse goddess Epona, who was worshipped as a protector of horses, and for her associations with fertility. However, the<b> cult </b>of Epona was not imported from Gaul (France) until around the <b><b>first century</b> CE</b>. This date is at least six centuries after the Uffington Horse was probably carved. Nevertheless, the horse had great<b> ritual </b>and economic significance during the Bronze and Iron Ages, as attested by its depictions on<b> jewellery </b>and other metal objects. It is possible that the carving represents a goddess in native mythology, such as Rhiannon, described in later Welsh<b> mythology </b>as a beautiful woman dressed in gold and riding a <b>white horse</b>.","The fact that<b> geoglyphs </b>can disappear easily, along with their associated rituals and meaning, indicates that they were <b>never intended</b> to be anything more than<b> temporary </b>gestures. But this does not lessen their importance. These giant carving are a fascinating glimpse into the minds of their creators and how they viewed the landscape in which they lived."]},{"name":"ARE/16-2-2","paragraph":["<h2>I contain multitudes</h2>","Wendy Moore reviews Ed Yong’s book about microbes","Microbes, most of them bacteria, have populated this planet since long before animal life developed and they will outlive us. Invisible to the naked eye, they are ubiquitous. They inhabit the soil, air, rocks and water and are present within every form of life, from seaweed and coral to dogs and humans. And, as Yong explains in his utterly absorbing and hugely important book we mess with them at our peril.","Every<b> species </b><b>has its own</b> colony of microbes, called a ‘microbiome’, and these<b> microbes </b>vary not only between<b> species </b>but also between individuals and within <b>different parts</b> of <b>each individual</b>. What is amazing is that while the number of human cells in the average person is about 30 trillion, the number of<b> microbial </b>ones is higher – about 39 trillion. At best, Yong informs us, we are only 50 <b>per cent</b> human. Indeed, <b>some scientists</b> even suggest we should think of each<b> species </b>and its<b> microbes </b>as a single unit,<b> dubbed </b>a ‘holobiont’.","In each human there are<b> microbes </b>that live only in the stomach, the mouth or the armpit and by and large they do so peacefully. So ‘bad’<b> microbes </b>are just<b> microbes </b>out of context.<b> Microbes </b>that sit contentedly in the human gut (where there are more<b> microbes </b>than there are stars in the galaxy) can become deadly if they <b>find their way</b> into the bloodstream. These communities are <b>constantly changing</b> too. The right hand shares <b>just one</b> sixth of its<b> microbes </b>with the <b>left hand</b>. And, of course, we are surrounded by microbes. <b>Every time</b> we eat, we swallow a million<b> microbes </b>in each gram of food; we are continually swapping<b> microbes </b>with other humans, pets and the world at large.","It’s a fascinating topic and Yong, a young British science journalist, is an extraordinarily adept guide. Writing with lightness and panache, he has a knack of explaining complex science in terms that are both easy to understand and totally enthralling. Yong is on a mission. Leading us gently by the hand, he takes us into the world of<b> microbes </b>– a bizarre, alien planet – in a bid to persuade us to love them as much as he does. By the end, we do.","For most of <b>human history</b> we <b>had <b>no idea</b></b> that<b> microbes </b>existed. The first man to see these extraordinarily<b> potent </b>creatures was a Dutch lens-maker called Antony van Leeuwenhoek in the 1670s. Using<b> microscopes </b>of his own design that could magnify up to 270 times, he examined a drop of water from a nearby lake and found it teeming with tiny creatures he called ‘animalcules’. It wasn’t until nearly <b>two <b>hundred years</b></b> later that the research of French biologist Louis Pasteur indicated that some<b> microbes </b>caused disease. It was Pasteur’s ‘germ theory’ that gave<b> bacteria </b>the poor image that endures today.","Yong’s book is in <b>many ways</b> a plea for<b> microbial </b>tolerance, pointing out that while fewer than <b>one hundred</b><b> species </b>of<b> bacteria </b>bring disease, many thousands more play a <b>vital role</b> in maintaining our health. The book also acknowledges that our attitude towards<b> bacteria </b>is not a simple one. We <b>tend to see</b> the dangers posed by bacteria, yet at the <b>same time</b> we are sold yoghurts and drinks that supposedly nurture ‘friendly’ bacteria. In reality, says Yong,<b> bacteria </b>should not be viewed as either friends or foes, villains or heroes. Instead we should realise we have a symbiotic relationship, that can be mutually beneficial or mutually destructive.","What then do these millions of organisms do? The answer is pretty much everything. <b>New research</b> is now<b> unravelling </b>the ways in which<b> bacteria </b>aid digestion, regulate our<b> immune </b>systems, eliminate toxins, produce vitamins, affect our behaviour and even combat obesity. ‘They actually help us become who we are,’ says Yong. But we are facing a growing problem. Our<b> obsession </b>with hygiene, our overuse of antibiotics and our unhealthy, low-fibre diets are disrupting the<b> bacterial </b>balance and may be<b> responsible </b>for soaring rates of allergies and<b> immune </b>problems, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).","The most <b>recent research</b> actually turns accepted norms upside down. For example, there are studies indicating that the<b> excessive </b>use of household<b> detergents </b>and<b> antibacterial </b>products actually destroys the<b> microbes </b>that normally keep the more dangerous germs at bay. Other <b>studies show</b> that keeping a dog as a pet gives children early<b> exposure </b>to a <b>diverse range</b> of bacteria, which may help protect them against allergies later.","The readers of Yong’s book must be prepared for a decidedly unglamorous world. Among the less<b> appealing </b>case studies is one about a<b> fungus </b>that is wiping out entire populations of frogs and that can be halted by a rare<b> microbial </b>bacterium. Another is about squid that carry luminescent<b> bacteria </b>that protect them against predators. However, if you can overcome your distaste for some of the investigations, the reasons for Yong’s<b> enthusiasm </b>become clear. The<b> microbial </b>world is a place of wonder. Already, in an attempt to stop<b> mosquitoes </b>spreading dengue fever – a disease that infects 400 <b>million people</b> a year –<b> mosquitoes </b>are being loaded with a<b> bacterium </b>to block the disease. In the future, our ability to manipulate<b> microbes </b>means we could construct buildings with useful<b> microbes </b>built into their walls to fight off infections.

Although the truly wise may seem few and far between,<b> empirical </b>research examining wisdom suggests that it isn’t an exceptional trait possessed by a small handful of bearded<b> philosophers </b>after all – in fact, the latest studies <b>suggest that most</b> of us have the ability to make wise decisions, given the right context.","‘It appears that experiential, situational, and cultural factors are even more powerful in shaping wisdom than previously imagined,’ says Associate Professor Igor Grossmann of the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada. ‘Recent<b> empirical </b>findings from cognitive, developmental, social, and personality<b> psychology </b>cumulatively suggest that people’s ability to reason wisely varies dramatically across<b> experiential </b>and situational contexts. Understanding the role of such<b> contextual </b>factors offers unique insights into understanding wisdom in daily life, as well as how it can be enhanced and taught.’","It seems that it’s not so much that <b>some people</b> simply possess wisdom and others lack it, but that our ability to reason wisely depends on a variety of<b> external </b>factors. ‘It is impossible to characterize thought processes attributed to wisdom without considering the role of<b> contextual </b>factors,’ explains Grossmann. ‘In other words, wisdom is not solely an “inner quality” but rather unfolds as a function of situations people happen to be in. Some situations are more likely to promote wisdom than others.’","<b>Coming up</b> with a definition of wisdom is challenging, but Grossmann and his <b>colleagues have</b> identified four key characteristics as part of a framework of wise reasoning. One is intellectual<b> humility </b>or recognition of the limits of our own knowledge, and another is appreciation of perspectives wider than the issue at hand.<b> Sensitivity </b>to the possibility of change in<b> social </b>relations is also key, along with<b> compromise </b>or integration of different attitudes and beliefs.","Grossmann and his <b>colleagues have</b> <b>also found</b> that <b>one of the most</b> reliable ways to support wisdom in our own day-to-day decisions is to look at<b> scenarios </b>from a third-party perspective, as though giving advice to a friend. <b>Research suggests</b> that when adopting a first-person viewpoint we focus on ‘the focal features of the environment’ and when we adopt a third-person, ‘observer’ viewpoint we reason more broadly and focus more on<b> interpersonal </b>and moral ideals such as justice and impartiality. Looking at problems from this more expansive viewpoint appears to<b> foster </b>cognitive processes related to wise decisions.","What are we to do, then, when confronted with situations like a disagreement with a spouse or negotiating a contract at work, that require us to take a personal stake? Grossmann argues that even when we aren’t able to change the situation, we can still evaluate these experiences from different perspectives.","For example, in one experiment that <b>took place</b> during the peak of a recent economic recession, graduating college<b> seniors </b>were asked to reflect on their job prospects. The students were instructed to imagine their career either ‘as if you were a distant observer’ or ‘before your own eyes as if you were right there’. Participants in the group assigned to the ‘distant observer’ role displayed more wisdom-related reasoning (intellectual<b> humility </b>and recognition of change) than did participants in the control group.","In <b>another study</b>, couples in long-term<b> romantic </b>relationships were instructed to visualize an<b> unresolved </b>relationship conflict either through the eyes of an<b> outsider </b>or from their own perspective. Participants then discussed the incident with their partner for 10 minutes, after which they wrote down their thoughts about it. Couples in the ‘other’s eyes’ condition were significantly more likely to rely on wise reasoning – recognizing others’ perspectives and searching for a<b> compromise </b>– compared to the couples in the egocentric condition.","‘Ego-decentering promotes greater focus on others and enables a bigger picture, conceptual view of the experience, affording recognition of intellectual<b> humility </b>and change,’ says Grossmann.","We might associate wisdom with intelligence or particular <b>personality traits</b>, but <b>research shows</b> only a small positive relationship between wise thinking and crystallized intelligence and the <b>personality traits</b> of openness and agreeableness. ‘It is remarkable how much people can vary in their wisdom from one situation to the next, and how much stronger such<b> contextual </b>effects are for understanding the relationship between wise judgment and its<b> social </b>and affective outcomes as compared to the generalized “traits”,’ Grossmann explains. ‘That is, knowing how wisely a person behaves in a given situation is more<b> informative </b>for understanding their emotions or<b> likelihood </b>to forgive [or] retaliate as compared to knowing whether the person may be wise “in general”.’"]},{"name":"ARE/16-3-1","paragraph":["<h2>Roman shipbuilding and navigation</h2>","Shipbuilding today is based on science and ships are built using computers and<b> sophisticated </b>tools.<b> Shipbuilding </b>in ancient Rome, however, was more of an art relying on estimation, inherited techniques and personal experience. The Romans were not traditionally sailors but mostly land-based people, who learned to build ships from the people that they conquered, namely the Greeks and the Egyptians.","There are a few surviving written documents that give descriptions and<b> representations </b>of <b>ancient Roman</b> ships, including the sails and rigging.<b> Excavated </b>vessels <b>also provide</b> some clues about ancient<b> shipbuilding </b>techniques. Studies of these have taught us that <b>ancient Roman</b><b> shipbuilders </b>built the outer<b> hull </b>first, then proceeded with the frame and the rest of the ship. Planks used to build the outer<b> hull </b>were initially<b> sewn </b>together. Starting from the 6th <b>century BCE</b>, they were fixed using a method called mortise and tenon, whereby one plank locked into another without the need for stitching. Then in the first centuries of the current era, Mediterranean<b> shipbuilders </b>shifted to another<b> shipbuilding </b>method, still in use today, which consisted of building the frame first and then proceeding with the<b> hull </b>and the other components of the ship. This method was more systematic and dramatically shortened<b> ship </b>construction times. The <b><b>ancient Roman</b>s</b> built large <b>merchant ships</b> and warships whose size and technology were unequalled until the 16th <b>century CE</b>.","Warships were built to be lightweight and very speedy. They had to be able to sail near the coast which is why they <b>had no</b> ballast or excess load and were built with a long, narrow hull. They did not sink when damaged and often would lie crippled on the sea’s surface following naval battles. They had a bronze battering ram, which was used to pierce the<b> timber </b>hulls or break the<b> oars </b>of enemy vessels. Warships used both wind (sails) and human power (oarsmen) and were therefore <b>very fast</b>. Eventually, Rome’s navy became the largest and most powerful in the Mediterranean, and the <b>Romans had</b> control over what they therefore called Mare Nostrum meaning ‘our sea’.","There were <b>many kinds</b> of warship. The ‘trireme’ was the<b> dominant </b>warship from the 7th to 4th <b>century BCE</b>. It had rowers in the top, <b>middle and lower</b> levels, and approximately 50 rowers in each bank. The rowers at the bottom had the most uncomfortable position as they were under the other rowers and were exposed to the water entering through the oar-holes. It is worth noting that contrary to popular perception, rowers were not slaves but mostly Roman citizens enrolled in the military. The trireme was<b> superseded </b>by larger ships with even more rowers.","<b>Merchant ships</b> were built to transport lots of cargo over <b>long distances</b> and at a reasonable cost. They had a wider hull, double planking and a solid interior for added stability. Unlike warships, their V-shaped<b> hull </b>was deep underwater, meaning that they could not sail <b>too close</b> to the coast. They usually had two huge side rudders located off the stern and controlled by a small tiller bar connected to a system of cables. They had from one to three masts with large square sails and a small triangular sail at the bow. <b>Just like</b> warships, <b>merchant ships</b> used oarsmen, but coordinating the hundreds of rowers in <b>both types</b> of<b> ship </b>was not an easy task. In order to assist them, music would be played on an instrument, and<b> oars </b>would then keep time with this.","The cargo on <b>merchant ships</b> included <b><b>raw material</b>s</b> (e.g. iron bars, copper, marble and granite), and agricultural products (e.g. grain from Egypt’s Nile valley). During the Empire, Rome was a huge city by ancient standards of about one million inhabitants. Goods from <b>all over the world</b> would come to the city through the port of Pozzuoli situated west of the bay of Naples in Italy and through the gigantic port of Ostia situated at the mouth of the Tiber River. Large <b>merchant ships</b> would approach the destination port and, <b>just like</b> today, be intercepted by a number of towboats that would drag them to the quay.","The time of travel along the many sailing routes could vary widely. Navigation in ancient Rome did not rely on<b> sophisticated </b>instruments <b>such as compasses</b> but on experience, local knowledge and observation of natural phenomena. In conditions of good visibility, seamen in the Mediterranean often had the mainland or islands in sight, which greatly<b> facilitated </b>navigation. They sailed by noting their position relative to a succession of recognisable landmarks. When <b>weather conditions</b> were not good or where land was <b>no longer</b> visible, Roman mariners<b> estimated </b>directions from the pole star or, with less accuracy, from the Sun at noon. They also<b> estimated </b>directions relative to the wind and swell.

They found that some periods had produced lots of artefacts, which indicates that <b>people had</b> been pretty active in the mountains during those times. But there were few or no signs of activity during other periods.","<b>F</b>","What was surprising, according to Barrett, was the timing of these periods. Oppland’s mountains present<b> daunting </b>terrain and in periods of extreme cold,<b> glaciers </b>could block the higher <b>mountain passes</b> and make travel in the upper reaches of the mountains extremely difficult. Archaeologists assumed people would<b> stick </b>to lower elevations during a time like the Late Antique Little <b>Ice Age</b>, a short period of deeper-than-usual cold from about 536-600 CE. But it turned out that hunters kept regularly venturing into the mountains even when the climate turned cold, based on the amount of stuff they had apparently dropped there.","‘Remarkably, though, the finds from the ice may have continued through this period, perhaps suggesting that the importance of mountain<b> hunting </b>increased to supplement failing agricultural harvests in times of low temperatures,’ says Barrett. A colder turn in the Scandinavian climate would likely <b>have meant</b> widespread crop failures, so more <b>people would have</b> depended on<b> hunting </b>to <b>make up</b> for those losses.","<b>G</b>","Many of the<b> artefacts </b>Barrett’s team recovered date from the beginning of the Viking Age, the 700s through to the 900s CE.

The warmer it is, the faster the<b> molecular </b>change –<b> stimulating </b><b>plant growth</b>.","<b>C</b>","Farmers and gardeners have known for <b>hundreds of years</b> how<b> responsive </b>plants are to temperature: <b>warm winter</b>s cause many trees and flowers to bud early, something <b>humans have</b> long used to predict weather and harvest times for the coming year. The latest research pinpoints for the <b>first time</b> a<b> molecular </b>mechanism in plants that reacts to<b> temperature </b>– often triggering the buds of spring we long to see at the end of winter.","<b>D</b>","With weather and<b> temperatures </b>set to become ever more unpredictable due to <b>climate change</b>, <b>researchers say</b> the discovery that this light-sensing<b> molecule </b>also functions as the internal<b> thermometer </b>in plant cells could help us breed tougher crops. ‘It is<b> estimated </b>that agricultural yields will <b>need to do</b>uble by 2050, but <b>climate change</b> is a major threat to achieving this. Key <b>crops such</b> as wheat and rice are sensitive to high temperatures.<b> Thermal </b>stress reduces <b>crop yields</b> by around 10% for <b>every one</b> degree increase in temperature,’ says <b>lead researcher</b> Dr Philip Wigge from Cambridge’s Sainsbury Laboratory. ‘Discovering the<b> molecules </b>that allow plants to sense<b> temperature </b>has the potential to accelerate the breeding of crops<b> resilient </b>to<b> thermal </b>stress and <b>climate change</b>.’","<b>E</b>","In their active state,<b> phytochrome </b>molecules bind themselves to DNA to restrict <b>plant growth</b>. <b>During the day</b>, sunlight activates the molecules, slowing down growth. If a plant finds itself in shade,<b> phytochromes </b>are quickly<b> inactivated </b>– enabling it to grow faster to find sunlight again. This is how plants compete to escape <b>each other</b>’s shade. ‘Light-driven changes to<b> phytochrome </b>activity occur <b>very fast</b>, in less than a second,’ says Wigge.","At night, however, it’s a different story. Instead of a rapid deactivation following sundown, the<b> molecules </b>gradually change from their active to <b>inactive state</b>. This is called ‘dark reversion’. ‘Just as<b> mercury </b>rises in a thermometer, the rate at which<b> phytochromes </b>revert to their <b>inactive state</b> during the night is a direct measure of temperature,’ says Wigge.","<b>F</b>","‘The lower the temperature, the slower the rate at which<b> phytochromes </b>revert to inactivity, so the<b> molecules </b>spend more time in their active, growth-suppressing state. This is why plants are slower to grow in winter. Warm<b> temperatures </b>accelerate dark reversion, so that<b> phytochromes </b>rapidly reach an <b>inactive state</b> and detach themselves from the plant’s DNA – allowing genes to be expressed and <b>plant growth</b> to resume.’ Wigge believes<b> phytochrome </b>thermo-sensing evolved at a later stage, and co-opted the biological network already used for light-based growth during the downtime of night.","<b>G</b>","Some plants mainly use day length as an indicator of the reason. <b>Other species</b>, such as daffodils, have considerable<b> temperature </b>sensitivity, and can flower <b>months in advance</b> during a <b>warm winter</b>. In fact, the discovery of the dual role of<b> phytochromes </b>provides the science behind a well-known rhyme long used to predict the coming season:<b> oak </b>before ash we’ll have a plash, ash before<b> oak </b>we’re in for a soak.","Wigge explains: ‘<b>Oak tree</b>s rely much more on temperature, likely using<b> phytochromes </b>as<b> thermometers </b>to dictate development, whereas ash trees rely on measuring day length to determine their<b> seasonal </b>timing. A warmer spring, and consequently a higher likeliness of a hot summer, will result in<b> oak </b>leafing before ash. A cold spring will see the opposite. As the British know only too well, a colder summer is likely to be a rain-soaked one.’","<b>H</b>","The new findings are the<b> culmination </b>of <b>twelve years</b> of research involving scientists from Germany, Argentina and the US, as well as the Cambridge team. The work was done in a model system, using a mustard plant called Arabidopsis, but Wigge says the<b> phytochrome </b>genes necessary for<b> temperature </b>sensing are found in crop plants as well. ‘Recent advances in plant genetics now mean that scientists are able to rapidly identify the genes controlling these processes in crop plants, and even alter their activity using precise<b> molecular </b>“scalpels”,’ adds Wigge. ‘Cambridge is uniquely well-positioned to do this kind of research as we have outstanding<b> collaborators </b>nearby who work on more applied aspects of plant biology, and can help us transfer this new knowledge into the field.’"]},{"name":"ARE/16-4-1","paragraph":["<h2>Roman tunnels</h2>","The Romans, who once controlled areas of Europe, North Africa and Asia Minor, adopted the construction techniques of other civilizations to build<b> tunnels </b>in their territories","The Persians, who lived in present-day Iran, were <b>one of the first</b> civilizations to build<b> tunnels </b>that provided a reliable supply of water to human settlements in dry areas. In the early first<b> millennium </b>BCE, they introduced the <b>qanat method</b> of<b> tunnel </b>construction, which consisted of placing posts over a hill in a<b> straight </b>line, to ensure that the<b> tunnel </b>kept to its route, and then<b> digging </b>vertical<b> shafts </b>down into the ground at regular intervals. Underground, workers removed the earth from between the ends of the shafts, creating a tunnel. The<b> excavated </b>soil was taken <b><b>up to the surface</b> using</b> the shafts, which <b><b>also provide</b>d</b><b> ventilation </b>during the work. Once the<b> tunnel </b>was completed, it allowed water to flow from the top of a hillside down towards a canal, which supplied water for human use. Remarkably, some qanats built by the Persians 2,700 <b>years ago</b> are still in use today.","They later passed on their knowledge to the Romans, who <b><b>also use</b>d</b> the <b>qanat method</b> to construct water-supply<b> tunnels </b>for agriculture. Roma qanat<b> tunnels </b>were constructed with vertical<b> shafts </b>dug at intervals of between 30 and 60 meters. The<b> shafts </b>were equipped with handholds and footholds to help those climbing in and out of them and were covered with a wooden or stone lid. To ensure that the<b> shafts </b>were vertical, Romans hung a plumb line from a rod placed across the top of each<b> shaft </b>and made sure that the weight at the end of it hung in the center of the shaft. Plumb lines were <b><b>also use</b>d</b> to measure the depth of the<b> shaft </b>and to determine the<b> slope </b>of the tunnel. The 5.6-kilometer-long Claudius tunnel, built in 41 CE to drain the Fucine Lake in central Italy, had<b> shafts </b>that were up to 122 meters deep, took 11 years to build and involved approximately 30,000 workers.","By the 6th <b>century BCE</b>, a second method of<b> tunnel </b>construction appeared called the counter-excavation method, in which the<b> tunnel </b>was constructed from both ends. It was used to cut through high mountains when the <b>qanat method</b> was not a practical alternative. This method required greater planning and advanced knowledge of surveying,<b> mathematics </b>and<b> geometry </b>as both ends of a<b> tunnel </b>had to meet correctly at the center of the mountain. Adjustments to the direction of the<b> tunnel </b><b>also had</b> to be made whenever builders encountered<b> geological </b>problems or when it deviated from its set path. They constantly checked the tunnel’s advancing direction, for example, by looking back at the light that penetrated through the<b> tunnel </b>mouth, and made corrections whenever necessary. Large deviations could happen, and they could result in <b>one end</b> of the<b> tunnel </b>not being usable. An inscription written on the side of a 428-meter tunnel, <b>built by the Romans</b> as part of the Saldae<b> aqueduct </b>system in modern-day Algeria, describes how the two teams of builders missed <b>each other</b> in the mountain and how the later construction of a lateral link between both corridors corrected the initial error.","The Romans dug<b> tunnels </b>for their roads using the counter-excavation method, whenever they encountered obstacles such as hills or mountains that were too high for roads to pass over. An example is the 37-meter-long, 6-meter-high, Furlo Pass<b> Tunnel </b>built in Italy in 69-79 CE. Remarkably, a modern road still uses this<b> tunnel </b>today.<b> Tunnels </b>were also built for mineral extraction. Miners would locate a mineral<b> vein </b>and then pursue it with<b> shafts </b>and<b> tunnels </b>underground. Traces of such<b> tunnels </b>used to mine gold can still be found at the Dolaucothi mines in Wales. When the sole purpose of a<b> tunnel </b>was mineral extraction, construction required less planning, as the<b> tunnel </b>route was determined by the mineral vein.","Roman<b> tunnel </b>projects were carefully <b>planned and carried</b> out. The length of time it took to construct a<b> tunnel </b>depended on the method being used and the type of rock being excavated. The<b> qanat </b>construction method was usually faster than the counter-excavation method as it was more straightforward. This was because the mountain could be<b> excavated </b>not only from the<b> tunnel </b>mouths but also from shafts. The type of rock could also influence construction times. When the rock was hard, the Romans employed a technique called fire quenching which consisted of heating the rock with fire, and then suddenly cooling it with <b>cold water</b> so that it would crack. Progress through hard rock could be very slow, and it was not uncommon for<b> tunnels </b>to take years, if not decades, to be built. Construction marks left on a Roman<b> tunnel </b>in Bologna show that the rate of advance through solid rock was 30 centimeters per day. In contrast, the rate of advance of the Claudius<b> tunnel </b>can be calculated at 1.4 meters per day. Most<b> tunnels </b>had<b> inscriptions </b>showing the names of<b> patrons </b>who ordered construction and sometimes the name of the architect. For example, the 1.4-kilometer Çevlik<b> tunnel </b>in Turkey, built to divert the floodwater<b> threatening </b>the harbor of the ancient city of Seleuceia Pieria, had<b> inscriptions </b>on the entrance, still visible today, that also indicate that the<b> tunnel </b>was started in 69 CE and was completed in 81 CE."]},{"name":"ARE/16-4-2","paragraph":["<h2>Changes in reading habits</h2>","What are the implications of the way we read today?","Look around on your next plane trip. The iPad is the new pacifier for babies and toddlers. Younger school-aged children read stories on smartphones; older kids don’t read at all, but hunch over video games. Parents and other passengers read on tablets or skim a flotilla of email and news feeds. Unbeknown to most of us, an invisible, game-changing transformation links everyone in this picture: the neuronal circuit that underlies the brain’s ability to read is subtly, rapidly changing and this has implications for everyone from the pre-reading toddler to the expert adult.","As work in neurosciences indicates, the acquisition of literacy necessitated a new circuit in our species’ brain more than 6,000 <b>years ago</b>. That circuit evolved from a <b>very simple</b> mechanism for decoding basic information, like the number of goats in one’s herd, to the present, highly elaborated <b>reading brain</b>. My research depicts how the present <b>reading brain</b> enables the development of some of our <b>most important</b> intellectual and affective processes: internalized knowledge, analogical reasoning, and inference; perspective-taking and empathy; <b>critical analysis</b> and the generation of insight. Research surfacing in <b>many <b>parts of the world</b></b> now cautions that each of these essential ‘<b>deep reading</b>’ processes may be under threat as we move into digital-based modes of reading.","This is not a simple, binary issue of print versus digital reading and technological innovations. As MIT scholar Sherry Turkle has written, we do not err as a society when we innovate but when we ignore what we<b> disrupt </b>or<b> diminish </b>while innovating. In this hinge moment between print and digital cultures, society needs to confront what is<b> diminishing </b>in the expert reading circuit, what our children and older students are not developing, and what we can do about it.","We know from research that the reading circuit is not given to <b>human beings</b> through a genetic blueprint like vision or language; it needs an environment to develop. Further, it will adapt to that environment’s requirements – from different writing systems to the characteristics of whatever medium is used. If the<b> dominant </b>medium advantages processes that are fast, multi-task<b> oriented </b>and well-suited for large volumes of information, like the current digital medium, so will the reading circuit. As UCLA<b> psychologist </b>Patricia Greenfield writes, the result is that less attention and time will be allocated to slower, time-demanding <b>deep <b>reading processes</b></b>.","Increasing reports from educators and from researchers in<b> psychology </b>and the<b> humanities </b>bear this out. English literature scholar and teacher Mark Edmundson describes how many <b>college students</b> actively avoid the classic literature of the 19th and 20th centuries in favour of something<b> simpler </b>as they <b>no longer</b> have the patience to read longer, denser, more difficult texts. We should be less concerned with students’ ‘cognitive impatience’, however, than by what may underlie it: the potential<b> inability </b>of <b><b>large number</b>s</b> of students to read with a level of <b>critical analysis</b> sufficient to<b> comprehend </b>the complexity of thought and argument found in more demanding texts.","Multiple <b>studies show</b> that digital screen use may be causing a variety of troubling downstream effects on reading<b> comprehension </b>in older high <b><b>school and college</b> students</b>. In Stavanger, Norway,<b> psychologist </b>Anne Mangen and colleagues studied how <b>high school</b> students<b> comprehend </b>the <b>same material</b> in different mediums. Mangen’s group asked subjects questions about a short story whose plot had universal student appeal; half of the students read the story on a tablet, the other half in paperback. Results indicated that students who read on print were<b> superior </b>in their<b> comprehension </b>to screen-reading peers, particularly in their ability to sequence detail and reconstruct the plot in <b>chronological order</b>.","Ziming Liu from San Jose <b>State University</b> has conducted a series of studies which indicate that the ‘new norm’ in reading is skimming, involving word-spotting and browsing through the text. Many readers now use a pattern when reading in which they sample the first line and then word-spot through the rest of the text. When the <b>reading brain</b> skims like this, it reduces time allocated to <b>deep <b>reading processes</b></b>. In other words, we don’t <b>have time</b> to grasp complexity, to understand another’s feelings, to perceive beauty, and to create thoughts of the reader’s own.","The possibility that <b>critical analysis</b>,<b> empathy </b>and other <b>deep <b>reading processes</b></b> could become the unintended ‘collateral damage’ of our digital culture is not a<b> straightforward </b>binary issue about print versus digital reading. It is about how we all <b>have begun</b> to read o various mediums and how that changes not only what we read, but also the purposes for which we read. Nor is it only about the young. The subtle atrophy of <b>critical analysis</b> and<b> empathy </b>affects us all equally. It affects our ability to navigate a constant bombardment of information. It incentivizes a<b> retreat </b>to the most familiar stores of unchecked information, which require and receive no analysis, leaving us<b> susceptible </b>to false information and<b> irrational </b>ideas.","There’s an old rule in<b> neuroscience </b>that does not alter with age: use it or lose it.

In addition, the expansion of the <b>overground railway</b> network resulted in more and more passengers arriving in the capital. However, in 1846, a Royal<b> Commission </b>decided that the railways should not be allowed to enter the City, the capital’s historic and business centre. The result was that the <b>overground railway</b> stations formed a ring around the City. The area within consisted of poorly built, overcrowded<b> slums </b>and the streets were full of horse-drawn traffic. Crossing the City became a nightmare. It could take an <b>hour and a half</b> to travel 8 km by horse-drawn carriage or bus.<b> Numerous </b>schemes were proposed to resolve these problems, but few succeeded.","Amongst the most vocal advocates for a solution to London’s traffic problems was Charles Pearson, who worked as a solicitor for the City of London. He saw both<b> social </b>and economic advantages in building an <b>underground railway</b> that would link the <b>overground railway</b> stations together and clear London<b> slums </b>at the <b>same time</b>. His idea was to relocate the poor workers who lived in the inner-city<b> slums </b>to newly constructed suburbs, and to provide cheap rail travel for them to <b>get to work</b>. Pearson’s ideas gained support amongst some businessmen and in 1851 he submitted a plan to Parliament. It was rejected, but<b> coincided </b>with a proposal from <b>another group</b> for an underground connecting line, which Parliament passed.","The two groups merged and established the Metropolitan <b>Railway Company</b> in August 1854. The company’s plan was to construct an <b>underground railway</b> line from the Great Western Railway’s (GWR) station at Paddington to the edge of the City at Farringdon Street – a distance of almost 5 km. The organisation <b>had difficulty</b> in raising the funding for such a<b> radical </b>and expensive scheme, not least because of the critical articles printed by the press. Objectors argued that the<b> tunnels </b>would collapse under the weight of traffic overhead, buildings would be<b> shaken </b>and passengers would be<b> poisoned </b>by the<b> emissions </b>from the train engines. However, Pearson and his partners persisted.","The GWR, aware that the new line would finally enable them to run trains into the heart of the City, invested almost £250,000 in the scheme. Eventually, over a five-year period, £Im was raised. The chosen route ran beneath existing <b>main road</b>s to minimise the expense of demolishing buildings. Originally scheduled to be completed in 21 months, the construction of the underground line took <b>three years</b>. It was built just below street level using a technique known as ‘cut and cover’. A trench about ten <b>metres wide</b> and six metres deep was dug, and the sides<b> temporarily </b>held up with<b> timber </b>beams.<b> Brick </b>walls were then constructed, and finally a<b> brick </b>arch was added to create a tmmel. A two-metre-deep layer of soil was<b> laid </b>on top of the<b> tunnel </b>and the road above rebuilt.","The Metropolitan line, which opened on 10 January 1863, was the world’s first <b>underground railway</b>. On its <b>first day</b>, almost 40,000 passengers were carried between Paddington and Farringdon, the journey taking about 18 minutes. By the end of the Metropolitan ‘s first year of operation, 9.5 million journeys had been made.","Even as the Metropolitan began operation, the first extensions to the line were being authorised; these were built over the next <b>five years</b>, reaching Moorgate in the east of London and Hammersmith in the west. The original plan was to pull the trains with steam locomotives, using firebricks in the boilers to provide steam, but these engines were never introduced. Instead, the line used<b> specially </b>designed<b> locomotives </b>that were fitted with water tanks in which steam could be condensed. However, smoke and<b> fumes </b>remained a problem, <b>even though</b><b> ventilation </b>shafts were added to the tunnels.","Despite the extension of the <b>underground railway</b>, by the 1880s, congestion on London’s streets <b>had become</b> worse. The problem was partly that the existing underground lines formed a circuit around the centre of London and extended to the suburbs, but did not cross the capital’s centre. The ‘cut and cover’ method of construction was not an option in this part of the capital. The only alternative was to<b> tunnel </b>deep underground.","Although the technology to create these<b> tunnels </b>existed, steam<b> locomotives </b>could not be used in such a confined space. It wasn’t until the development of a reliable electric motor, and a means of<b> transferring </b>power from the generator to a moving train, that the world’s first deep-level electric railway, the City & <b>South London</b>, became possible. The line opened in 1890, and ran from the City to Stockwell, south of the River Thames. The trains were <b>made up</b> of three<b> carriages </b>and driven by electric engines. The<b> carriages </b>were narrow and had tiny windows just below the roof because it was thought that passengers would not <b>want to look</b> out at the<b> tunnel </b>walls. The line was not without its problems, mainly caused by an<b> unreliable </b>power supply. Although the City & <b>South London</b> Railway was a great technical achievement, it did not make a profit. Then, in 1900, the Central London Railway, known as the ‘Tuppenny Tube’, began operation using new electric locomotives. It was <b>very popular</b> and soon afterwards new railways and extensions were added to the growing tube network. By 1907, the heart of today’s Underground system was in place."]},{"name":"ARE/17-1-2","paragraph":["<h2>Stadiums: Past, Present and Future</h2>","<b>READING PASSAGE</b> 2","You should spend about 20 <b>minutes on Questions</b> 14-26, which are <b><b>based on Reading</b> Passage</b> 2 below.","Stadiums- Past Present Future <b>ielts <b>reading <b>answers <b>pdf explanation</b></b></b></b>","Source: TFC Stadiums","<b>A)</b> <b> Stadiums </b>are among the oldest forms of urban architecture: vast<b> stadiums </b>where the public could watch sporting events were at the centre of western <b>city life</b> as <b>far back</b> as the <b>ancient Greek</b> and Roman Empires, well before the construction of the great<b> medieval </b>cathedrals and the grand 19th- and 20th-century <b>railway stations</b> which<b> dominated </b>urban skylines in later eras.","Today, however,<b> stadiums </b>are regarded with growing scepticism. Construction costs can soar above £1 billion, and<b> stadiums </b>finished for major events such as the Olympic Games or the FIFA World Cup <b>have no</b>tably fallen into<b> disuse </b>and disrepair.","But this need not be the case. History shows that<b> stadiums </b>can drive urban development and adapt to the culture of every age. Even today, architects and planners are finding <b>new ways</b> to adapt the mono-functional sports arenas which became emblematic of modernisation during the 20th century.","<b>B)</b>  The amphitheatre* of Aries in southwest France, with a capacity of 25,000 spectators, is perhaps the best example of just how versatile<b> stadiums </b>can be. <b>Built by the Romans</b> in 90 AD, it became a<b> fortress </b>with four towers after the fifth century, and was then transformed into a village containing more than 200 houses. With the growing interest in conservation during the 19th century, it was converted back into an arena for the staging of bullfights, thereby returning the structure to its original use as a<b> venue </b>for public spectacles.","Another example is the<b> imposing </b>arena of Verona in northern Italy, with space for 30,000 spectators, which was built 60 years before the Arles<b> amphitheatre </b>and 40 years before Rome’s famous Colosseum. It has endured the centuries and is currently considered one of the world’s prime sites for opera, thanks to its<b> outstanding </b>acoustics.","<b>C)</b>  The area in the centre of the Italian town of Lucca, known as the Piazza dell’Anfiteatro, is yet another<b> impressive </b>example of an<b> amphitheatre </b>becoming absorbed into the fabric of the city. The site evolved in a similar way to Aries and was<b> progressively </b>filled with buildings from the <b>Middle Ages</b> until the 19th century, variously used as houses, a salt depot and a prison. But rather than reverting to an arena, it became a market square, designed by Romanticist architect Lorenzo Nottolini. Today, the ruins of the<b> amphitheatre </b>remain embedded in the various shops and residences surrounding the public square.","<b>D)</b>  There are many<b> similarities </b>between modern<b> stadiums </b>and the ancient amphitheatres intended for games. But some of the flexibility was lost at the beginning of the 20th century, as<b> stadiums </b>were developed using new <b>products such</b> as<b> steel </b>and reinforced concrete, and made use of bright lights for night-time matches.","Many such<b> stadiums </b>are situated in<b> suburban </b>areas, designed for sporting <b>use only</b> and surrounded by parking lots. These factors mean that they may not be as accessible to the general public, require more energy to run and contribute to urban heat.","<b>E)</b>  But many of today’s most innovative architects see scope for the<b> stadium </b>to <b>help improve</b> the city. Among the current strategies, two seem to be having particular success: the<b> stadium </b>as an urban hub, and as a power plant.","There’s a growing trend for<b> stadiums </b>to be equipped with public spaces and services that serve a function beyond sport, such as hotels, retail outlets, conference centres, restaurants and bars, children’s playgrounds and green space. Creating mixed-use developments such as this reinforces compactness and multi-functionality, making more efficient use of land and helping to<b> regenerate </b>urban spaces.","This opens the space up to families and a wider cross-section of society, instead of<b> catering </b>only to sportspeople and supporters. There have been many examples of this in the United Kingdom: the mixed-use<b> facilities </b>at Wembley and Old Trafford <b>have become</b> a blueprint for <b>m<b>any other</b></b><b> stadiums </b>in the world.","<b>F)</b>  The<b> phenomenon </b>of<b> stadiums </b>as power stations has arisen from the idea that energy problems can be overcome by integrating interconnected buildings by means of a smart grid, which is an electricity supply network that uses digital communications technology to detect and react to local changes in usage, without significant energy losses.<b> Stadiums </b>are ideal for these purposes, because their<b> canopies </b>have a large surface area for :fitting<b> photovoltaic </b>panels and rise <b>high enough</b> (more than 40 metres) to <b>make use</b> of<b> micro </b>wind turbines.","Freiburg Mage Solar<b> Stadium </b>in Germany is the first of a new wave of<b> stadiums </b>as power plants, which <b>also includes</b> the Amsterdam Arena and the Kaohsiung Stadium. The latter, inaugurated in 2009, has 8,844<b> photovoltaic </b>panels producing up to 1.14 GWh of electricity annually. This reduces the annual output of <b>carbon dioxide</b> by 660 tons and supplies up to 80 percent of the surrounding area when the<b> stadium </b>is not in use. This is proof that a<b> stadium </b>can serve its city, and have a decidedly <b>positive impact</b> in terms of<b> reduction </b>of CO2 emissions.","<b>G)</b>  Sporting arenas <b>have always</b> been central to the life and culture of cities. In every era, the<b> stadium </b>has acquired new value and uses: from military<b> fortress </b>to<b> residential </b>village, public space to theatre and <b>most recently</b> a field for experimentation in advanced engineering.","The<b> stadium </b>of today now <b>brings together</b> multiple functions, thus helping cities to create a<b> sustainable </b>future."]},{"name":"ARE/17-1-3","paragraph":["<h2>To Catch A King</h2>","<b>READING PASSAGE</b> 3","You should spend about 20 <b>minutes on Questions</b> 27-40, which are <b><b>based on Reading</b> Passage</b> 3 below.","To <b>catch a king</b> <b>ielts <b>reading <b>answers <b>pdf explanation</b></b></b></b>","Anna Keay reviews Charles Spencer s book about the hunt for King <b>Charles II</b> during the English <b>Civil War</b> of the <b>seventeenth century</b>.","Charles Spencer’s latest book, To <b>Catch a King</b>, tells us the story of the hunt for King <b>Charles II</b> in the <b>six weeks</b> after his resounding defeat at the Battle of Worcester in September 1651. And what a story it is. After his father was executed by the Parliamentarians in 1649, the young <b>Charles II</b><b> sacrificed </b>one of the very<b> principles </b>his father had died for and did a deal with the Scots, thereby accepting Presbyterianism* as the national religion in return for being<b> crowned </b>King of Scots. His arrival in Edinburgh prompted the English Parliamentary army to invade Scotland in a pre-emptive strike. This was followed by a Scottish invasion of England. The <b>two sides</b> finally faced <b>one another</b> at Worcester in the <b>west of England</b> in 1651. After being comprehensively defeated on the meadows outside the city by the Parliamentarian army, the 21-year-old king found himself the subject of a national manhunt, with a huge sum offered for his capture. Over the following <b>six weeks</b> he managed, through a series of heart-poundingly close escapes, to evade the Parliamentarians before seeking<b> refuge </b>in France. For the next nine years, the penniless and defeated Charles wandered around Europe with only a <b>small group</b> of loyal supporters.","<b>Years later</b>, after his<b> restoration </b>as king, the 50-year-old <b>Charles II</b> requested a meeting with the writer and diarist Samuel Pepys. His intention when asking Pepys to commit his story to paper was to ensure that this most extraordinary episode was <b>never forgotten</b>. Over two three-hour sittings, the king related to him in great detail his personal recollections of the <b>six weeks</b> he had spent as a fugitive. As the king and<b> secretary </b>settled down (a<b> scene </b>that is surely a gift for a future scriptwriter), Charles commenced his story: ‘After the battle was so absolutely lost as to be beyond hope of recovery, I began to think of the <b>best way</b> of saving myself.’","One of the joys of Spencer’s book, a result not least of its use of <b>Charles II</b>’s own narrative as well as those of his supporters, is just how close the reader gets to the action. The day-by­ day retelling of the fugitives’ doings provides delicious details: the cutting of the king’s <b>long hair</b> with agricultural shears, the use of walnut leaves to<b> dye </b>his<b> pale </b>skin, and the day Charles spent lying on a branch of the great <b>oak tree</b> in Boscobel Wood as the Parliamentary soldiers<b> scoured </b>the forest floor below. Spencer draws out both the humour – such as the preposterous refusal of Charles’s friend Henry Wilmot to adopt disguise on the grounds that it was beneath his dignity – and the emotional tension when the secret of the king’s presence was cautiously revealed to his supporters.","Charles’s adventures after losing the Battle of Worcester hide the uncomfortable truth that<b> whilst </b><b>almost every</b>one in England had been appalled by the execution of his father, they <b>had no</b>t welcomed the arrival of his son with the Scots army, but had instead firmly<b> bolted </b>their doors. This was <b>partly because</b> he rode at the head of what <b>looked like</b> a foreign invasion force and <b>partly because</b>, after almost a decade of <b>civil war</b>, people were<b> desperate </b>to avoid it beginning again. This makes it all the more interesting that <b>Charles II</b> himself loved the story so much ever after. As well as retelling it to anyone who would listen, causing eye­ rolling among courtiers, he set in train a series of initiatives to memorialise it. There was to be a new order of chivalry, the Knights of the Royal Oak. A series of enormous oil paintings depicting the episode were produced, including a two-metre-wide canvas of Boscobel Wood and a set of six<b> similarly </b>enormous paintings of the king on the run. In 1660, <b>Charles II</b><b> commissioned </b>the artist John Michael Wright to paint a flying squadron of cherubs* carrying an <b>oak tree</b> to the heavens on the ceiling of his bedchamber. It is hard to imagine <b>m<b>any other</b></b> kings marking the lowest point in their life so enthusiastically, or indeed pulling off such an escape in the <b>first place</b>.","Charles Spencer is the perfect person to pass the story on to a <b>new generation</b>. His pacey, readable prose steers deftly clear of modern idioms and elegantly brings to life the details of the great tale. He has even-handed sympathy for both the<b> fugitive </b>king and the fierce republican<b> regime </b>that hunted him, and he succeeds in his desire to explore far more of the background of the story than previous books on the subject <b>have done</b>. Indeed, the opening third of the book is about how <b>Charles II</b> found himself at Worcester in the <b>first place</b>, which for some will be reason alone to read To <b>Catch a King</b>.","The tantalising question left, in the end, is that of what it all meant. Would <b>Charles II</b> have been a different king had these <b>six weeks</b> never happened? The days and nights spent in hiding must <b>have affected</b> him in <b>some way</b>. Did the need to assume disguises, to survive on wit and charm alone, to use trickery and subterfuge to escape from tight corners help form him? This is the <b>one area</b> where the book doesn’t quite hit the mark. Instead its depiction of <b>Charles II</b> in his <b>final year</b>s as an ineffective, pleasure-loving monarch doesn’t do justice to the man (neither is it accurate), or to the complexity of his character. But this one niggle aside, To <b>Catch a King</b> is an<b> excellent </b>read, and those who come to it knowing little of the famous tale will find they have a treat in store."]},{"name":"ARE/17-2-1","paragraph":["<h2>The Dead Sea Scrolls</h2>","<b>READING PASSAGE</b> 1","You should spend about 20 <b>minutes on Questions</b> 1-13, which are <b><b>based on Reading</b> Passage</b> 1 below.","In late 1946 or early 1947, three Bedouin teenagers were tending their goats and sheep near the ancient settlement of Qumran, located on the northwest shore of the <b>Dead Sea</b> in what is <b>now known</b> as the West Bank. One of these young<b> shepherds </b>tossed a rock into an opening on the side of a cliff and was surprised to hear a shattering sound. He and his<b> companions </b>later entered the cave and stumbled across a collection of large clay jars, seven of which contained scrolls with writing on them. The teenagers took the seven scrolls to a nearby town where they were sold for a small sum to a local antiquities dealer. Word of the find spread, and Bedouins and archaeologists eventually<b> unearthed </b><b>tens of thousands</b> of additional scroll fragments from 10 nearby caves; together they <b>make up</b> between 800 and 900 manuscripts. It soon became clear that this was <b>one of the great</b>est archaeological discoveries ever made.","The origin of the <b>Dead <b>Sea Scrolls</b></b>, which were written around 2,000 <b>years ago</b> between 150 BCE and 70 CE, is still the subject of scholarly debate even today. According to the<b> prevailing </b>theory, they are the work of a population that<b> inhabited </b>the area until Roman troops destroyed the settlement around 70 CE. The area was known as Judea at that time, and the people are <b>thought to have</b> belonged to a <b>group called</b> the Essenes, a devout Jewish sect.","The majority of the texts on the <b>Dead <b>Sea Scrolls</b></b> are in Hebrew, with some fragments written in an ancient version of its alphabet <b>thought to have</b> fallen out of use in the fifth <b>century BCE</b>. But there are other languages as well. Some scrolls are in Aramaic, the language spoken by many<b> inhabitants </b>of the region from the <b>sixth century</b> BCE to the siege of Jerusalem in 70 CE. In addition, several texts feature translations of the Hebrew Bible into Greek.","The <b>Dead <b>Sea Scrolls</b></b> include fragments from every book of the Old Testament of the Bible except for the Book of Esther. The only entire book of the Hebrew Bible<b> preserved </b>among the<b> manuscripts </b>from Qumran is Isaiah; this copy, dated to the <b>first century</b> BCE, is considered the earliest biblical<b> manuscript </b>still in existence. Along with<b> biblical </b>texts, the scrolls include documents about sectarian regulations and<b> religious </b>writings that do not appear in the Old Testament.","The writing on the <b>Dead <b>Sea Scrolls</b></b> is mostly in black or occasionally red ink, and the scrolls themselves are <b>nearly all</b> made of either<b> parchment </b>(animal skin) or an early form of paper called ‘papyrus’. The only exception is the scroll numbered 3Q15, which was created out of a combination of copper and tin. Known as the Copper Scroll, this<b> curious </b>document features letters chiselled onto metal – perhaps, as <b>some have</b> theorized, to better<b> withstand </b>the passage of time. <b>One of the most</b> intriguing<b> manuscripts </b>from Qumran, this is a sort of ancient treasure map that lists dozens of gold and silver caches. Using an unconventional vocabulary and odd spelling, it describes 64 underground hiding places that supposedly contain riches buried for safekeeping. None of these hoards have been recovered, <b>possibly because</b> the Romans pillaged Judea <b>during the first</b> <b>century CE</b>. According to various hypotheses, the treasure belonged to <b>local people</b>, or was rescued from the Second Temple before its destruction or never existed to begin with.","Some of the <b>Dead <b>Sea Scrolls</b></b> have been on interesting journeys. In 1948, a Syrian Orthodox archbishop known as Mar Samuel acquired four of the original seven scrolls from a Jerusalem shoemaker and part-time antiquity dealer, paying less than $100 for them. He then travelled to the <b>United States</b> and unsuccessfully offered them to a number of universities, including Yale. Finally, in 1954, he placed an advertisement in the business newspaper The Wall Street Journal- under the category ‘Miscellaneous Items for Sale’ – that read: ‘Biblical<b> Manuscripts </b>dating back to at least 200 B.C. are for sale.

And they <b>have done</b> it <b>better in some</b> ways, as the re-domesticated tomatoes are more<b> nutritious </b>than the ones we eat at present.","This approach relies on the<b> revolutionary </b>CRISPR genome editing technique, in which changes are deliberately made to the DNA of a living cell, allowing genetic material to be added, removed or altered. The technique could not only improve existing crops, but could also be used to turn thousands of wild plants into useful and<b> appealing </b>foods. In fact, a third team in the US <b>has already</b> begun to do this with a relative of the tomato called the groundcherry.","This fast-track domestication could help make the world’s food supply healthier and far more<b> resistant </b>to diseases, such as the<b> rust </b>fungus<b> devastating </b>wheat crops.","‘This could transform what we eat,’ says Jorg Kudla at the University of Munster in Germany, a member of the Brazilian team. ‘There are 50,000 edible plants in the world, but 90 percent of our energy comes from just 15 crops.’","‘We can now mimic the known domestication course of major crops like rice, maize, sorghum or others,’ says Caixia Gao of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing. ‘Then we might <b>try to do</b>mesticate <b>plants that have</b> never been domesticated.’","<b>B)</b>  Wild tomatoes, which are native to the Andes region in <b>South America</b>, produce pea-sized fruits. Over many generations, peoples such as the Aztecs and Incas transformed the plant by selecting and breeding plants with mutations* in their genetic structure, which resulted in <b>desirable traits</b> such as larger fruit.","But <b>every time</b> a single plant with a mutation is taken from a larger population for breeding, much genetic diversity is lost. And sometimes the desirable<b> mutations </b>come with less <b>desirable traits</b>. For instance, the tomato<b> strains </b>grown for <b>supermarkets have</b> lost much of their flavour. By comparing the genomes of modern plants to those of their wild relatives, biologists <b>have been working</b> out what genetic changes<b> occurred </b>as plants were domesticated. The teams in Brazil and China have <b>now used</b> this knowledge to reintroduce these changes from<b> scratch </b>while maintaining or even enhancing the <b>desirable traits</b> of wild strains.","<b>C)</b>  Kudla’s <b>team made</b> six changes altogether. For instance, they tripled the size of fruit by editing a gene called FRUIT WEIGHT, and increased the number of tomatoes per truss by editing another called MULTIFLORA.","While the historical domestication of tomatoes reduced levels of the red pigment<b> lycopene </b>– <b>thought to have</b> potential <b>health benefits</b> – the team in Brazil managed to boost it instead. The wild tomato has twice as much<b> lycopene </b>as cultivated ones; the newly domesticated <b>one has</b> <b>five times</b> as much.","‘They are quite tasty,’ says Kudla. ‘A little bit strong. And very aromatic.’ The team in China re-domesticated several<b> strains </b>of wild tomatoes with <b>desirable traits</b> lost in domesticated tomatoes. In this way they managed to create a strain<b> resistant </b>to a common <b>disease called</b><b> bacterial </b>spot race, which can devastate yields. They also created another<b> strain </b>that is more salt tolerant – and has <b>higher level</b>s of vitamin C.","<b>D)</b>  Meanwhile, Joyce Van Eck at the Boyce Thompson Institute in <b>New York</b> state <b>decided to use</b> the <b>same approach</b> to domesticate the<b> groundcherry </b>or goldenberry (Physalis pruinosa) for the <b>first time</b>. This fruit looks similar to the closely related Cape gooseberry (Physalis peruviana).","Groundcherries are already sold to a limited extent in the US but they are hard to produce because the plant has a sprawling growth habit and the small fruits fall off the branches when ripe. Van Eck’s team has edited the plants to increase fruit size, make their growth more compact and to stop fruits dropping. ‘There’s potential for this to be a commercial crop,’ says Van Eck. But she adds that taking the work further would be expensive because of the <b>need to pay</b> for a<b> licence </b>for the CRISPR technology and get regulatory approval.","<b>E)</b>  This approach could boost the use of many<b> obscure </b>plants, says Jonathan Jones of the Sainsbury Lab in the UK. But it will be hard for <b>new food</b>s to grow so popular with farmers and consumers that they become new<b> staple </b>crops, he thinks.","The three teams <b>already have</b> their eye on <b>other plants</b> that could be ‘catapulted into the mainstream’, including foxtail, oat-grass and cowpea. By choosing wild plants that are<b> drought </b>or heat tolerant, says Gao, we could create crops that will thrive even as the planet warms.","But Kudla didn’t want to reveal which<b> species </b>were in his team’s sights, because CRISPR <b>has made</b> the process so easy. ‘<b>Any one</b> with the right skills could go to their lab and do this.’"]},{"name":"ARE/17-2-3","paragraph":["<h2>Insight or evolution?</h2>","<b>READING PASSAGE</b> 3","You should spend about 20 <b>minutes on Questions</b> 27-40, which are <b><b>based on Reading</b> Passage</b> 3 below.","Two scientists consider the origins of discoveries and other innovative behavior","<b>Scientific discovery</b> is popularly believed to result from the<b> sheer </b>genius of such intellectual stars as<b> naturalist </b>Charles Darwin and<b> theoretical </b>physicist Albert Einstein. Our view of such unique contributions to science often disregards the person’s prior experience and the efforts of their lesser-known predecessors. Conventional wisdom also places great weight on insight in promoting breakthrough scientific achievements, as if ideas<b> spontaneously </b>pop into someone’s head – fully formed and functional.","There may be some limited truth to this view. However, we believe that it largely misrepresents the real nature of <b>scientific discovery</b>, as well as that of creativity and innovation in <b>m<b>any other</b></b> realms of human endeavor.","Setting aside such greats as Darwin and Einstein – whose<b> monumental </b>contributions are duly celebrated – we suggest that innovation is more a process of trial and error, where two steps forward may <b>sometimes come</b> with one step back, as well as one or more steps to the right or left. This evolutionary view of human innovation undermines the notion of creative genius and recognizes the cumulative nature of scientific progress.","<b>Consider one</b> unheralded scientist: John Nicholson, a<b> mathematical </b>physicist working in the 191Os who postulated the existence of ‘proto-elements’ in outer space. By combining different numbers of weights of these proto-elements’ atoms, Nicholson could recover the weights of all the elements in the then-known periodic table. These successes are all the more<b> noteworthy </b>given the fact that Nicholson was wrong about the presence of proto-elements: they do not actually exist. Yet, amid his often fanciful theories and wild speculations, Nicholson also proposed a novel theory about the structure of atoms. Niels Bohr, the Nobel prize-winning father of modern atomic theory, jumped off from this interesting idea to<b> conceive </b>his now-famous model of the atom.","What are we to make of this story? One might simply conclude that science is a collective and cumulative enterprise. That may be true, but there may be a <b>deeper insight</b> to be gleaned. We propose that science is constantly evolving, much as<b> species </b>of animals do. In biological systems, organisms may display new characteristics that result from random genetic mutations. In the same way, random, arbitrary or accidental<b> mutations </b>of ideas may help pave the way for advances in science. If<b> mutations </b>prove beneficial, then the animal or the scientific theory will continue to thrive and perhaps reproduce.","Support for this evolutionary view of behavioral innovation comes from many domains. <b>Consider one</b> example of an influential innovation in US horseracing. The so-called ‘acey-deucy’<b> stirrup </b>placement, in which the rider’s foot in his left<b> stirrup </b>is placed as much as 25 centimeters lower than the right, is believed to confer important speed advantages when turning on oval tracks. It was developed by a relatively unknown jockey named Jackie Westrope. Had Westrope conducted methodical investigations or examined extensive film records in a shrewd plan to outrun his rivals? Had he foreseen the speed advantage that would be conferred by riding acey-deucy? No. He suffered a leg injury, which left him unable to fully bend his left knee. His modification just happened to<b> coincide </b>with enhanced left-hand turning performance. This led to the rapid and widespread adoption of riding acey-deucy by many riders, a racing style which continues in today’s thoroughbred racing.","Plenty of other stories show that fresh advances can arise from error, misadventure, and also pure<b> serendipity </b>– a happy accident. For example, in the early 1970s, two employees of the company 3M <b>each had</b> a problem: Spencer Silver had a product – a glue which was only slightly sticky – and no use for it, while his colleague Art Fry was trying to figure out how to affix<b> temporary </b>bookmarks in his hymn book without damaging its pages. The solution to both these problems was the invention of the brilliantly simple yet phenomenally successful Post-It note. Such examples give lie to the claim that ingenious, designing minds are<b> responsible </b>for human creativity and invention. Far more<b> banal </b>and mechanical forces may be at work; forces that are fundamentally connected to the Laws of science.","The notions of insight, creativity and genius are often invoked, but they remain vague and of doubtful scientific utility, especially when one considers the diverse and enduring contributions of individuals such as Plato, <b>Leonardo da</b> Vinci, Shakespeare, Beethoven, Galileo, Newton, Kepler, Curie, Pasteur and Edison. These notions merely label rather than explain the evolution of human innovations. We need another approach, and there is a promising candidate.","The <b>Law of Effect</b> was advanced by<b> psychologist </b>Edward Thorndike in 1898, some 40 years after Charles Darwin published his groundbreaking work on biological evolution, On the Origin of Species. This simple law holds that organisms tend to repeat successful behaviors and to refrain from performing<b> unsuccessful </b>ones. <b>Just like</b> Darwin’s Law of Natural Selection, the <b>Law of Effect</b> involves an entirely mechanical process of variation and selection, without any end objective in sight.","Of course, the origin of human innovation demands much further study. In particular, the provenance of the <b>raw material</b> on which the <b>Law of Effect</b> operates is not as clearly known as that of the genetic<b> mutations </b>on which the Law of Natural Selection operates. The generation of novel ideas and behaviors may not be entirely random, but constrained by prior successes and failures – of the current individual (such as Bohr) or of<b> predecessors </b>(such as Nicholson).","The time seems right for abandoning the naive notions of intelligent design and genius, and for<b> scientifically </b>exploring the true origins of creative behaviour."]},{"name":"ARE/17-3-1","paragraph":["<h2>The Thylacine</h2>","<b>READING PASSAGE</b> 1","You should spend about 20 <b>minutes on Questions</b> 1-13, which are <b><b>based on Reading</b> Passage</b> 1 below.","The<b> Thylacine </b><b><b>IELTS <b>reading <b>answers explanation</b></b></b> PDF</b>","Source: Wikipedia","The extinct thylacine, <b>also known</b> as the Tasmanian tiger, was a marsupial* that bore a superficial<b> resemblance </b>to a dog. Its most distinguishing feature was the 13-19 dark brown stripes over its back, beginning at the rear of the body and extending onto the tail. The thylacine’s average nose­ to-tail length for adult males was 162.6 cm, compared to 153.7 cm for females.","The<b> thylacine </b>appeared to occupy most types of<b> terrain </b>except dense rainforest, with open<b> eucalyptus </b>forest thought to be its prime habitat. In terms of feeding, it was<b> exclusively </b>carnivorous, and its stomach was muscular with an ability to distend so that it could eat <b><b>large amount</b>s</b> of food at <b>one time</b>, probably an adaptation to compensate for long periods when<b> hunting </b>was<b> unsuccessful </b>and food scarce. The<b> thylacine </b>was not a fast runner and probably caught its<b> prey </b>by exhausting it during a long pursuit. During long-distance chases,<b> thylacines </b>were <b>likely to have</b> relied more on<b> scent </b>than <b>any other</b> sense. They emerged to hunt during the evening, night and <b>early morning</b> and tended to<b> retreat </b>to the hills and forest for shelter <b>during the day</b>. Despite the common name ‘tiger’, the<b> thylacine </b>had a shy, nervous temperament. Although mainly nocturnal, it was sighted moving <b>during the day</b> and some individuals were even recorded basking in the sun.","The<b> thylacine </b>had an extended <b>breeding season</b> from winter to spring, with indications that some breeding <b>took place</b> <b>throughout the year</b>. The thylacine, <b>like all</b> marsupials, was tiny and hairless when born. Newborns crawled into the<b> pouch </b>on the belly of their mother, and attached themselves to <b>one of the four</b> teats, remaining there for <b>up to three</b> months. When old enough to leave the pouch, the young stayed in a lair such as a deep rocky cave, well-hidden nest or<b> hollow </b>log,<b> whilst </b>the mother hunted. Approximately 4,000 <b>years ago</b>, the<b> thylacine </b>was widespread throughout <b>New Guinea</b> and most of mainland Australia, as well as the island of Tasmania. The most recent, well-dated<b> occurrence </b>of a<b> thylacine </b>on the mainland is a carbon-dated<b> fossil </b>from Murray Cave in Western Australia, which is around 3,100 <b>years old</b>. Its extinction<b> coincided </b>closely with the arrival of wild dogs called dingoes in Australia and a similar predator in <b>New Guinea</b>. Dingoes never reached Tasmania, and <b>most scientists</b> see this as the <b>main reason</b> for the thylacine’s survival there.","The dramatic decline of the<b> thylacine </b>in Tasmania, which began in the 1830s and continued for a century, is generally attributed to the<b> relentless </b>efforts of sheep farmers and<b> bounty </b>hunters** with shotguns. While this determined campaign undoubtedly played a large part, it is likely that various other factors also contributed to the decline and eventual extinction of the species. These include competition with wild dogs introduced by European settlers, loss of habitat along with the disappearance of<b> prey </b>species, and a distemper-like disease which may also <b>have affected</b> the thylacine.","There was <b>only one</b> successful attempt to breed a<b> thylacine </b>in captivity, at Melbourne Zoo in 1899. This was despite the <b><b>large number</b>s</b> that went through some zoos, particularly London Zoo and Tasmania’s Hobart Zoo. The famous<b> naturalist </b>John Gould foresaw the thylacine’s<b> demise </b>when he published his Mammals of Australia between 1848 and 1863, writing, ‘The numbers of this singular animal will speedily diminish, extermination will have its full sway, and it will then, like the wolf of England and Scotland, be recorded as an animal of the past.’","However, there <b>seems to have</b> been little public pressure to<b> preserve </b>the thylacine, nor was much concern expressed by scientists at the decline of this<b> species </b>in the decades that followed. A notable exception was T.T. Flynn, Professor of Biology at the University of Tasmania. In 1914, he was sufficiently concerned about the<b> scarcity </b>of the<b> thylacine </b>to suggest that some should be captured and placed on a <b>small island</b>. But it was not until 1929, with the<b> species </b>on the very edge of extinction, that Tasmania’s Animals and Birds Protection Board passed a motion protecting<b> thylacines </b>only for the month of December, which was thought to be their prime <b>breeding season</b>.

Is it desirable to have <b>palm oil</b> boycotted, replaced, eliminated from the global supply chain, given how many low-income people in <b>developing countries</b> depend on it for their livelihoods? How best to strike a<b> utilitarian </b>balance between these competing factors <b>has <b>become a serious</b></b> bone of contention.","<b>F)</b>  Even the<b> deforestation </b>argument isn’t as<b> straightforward </b>as it seems. <b>Oil <b>palm plantations</b></b> produce at <b>least four</b> and potentially up to <b>ten times</b> more oil per<b> hectare </b>than soybean, rapeseed, sunflower or other competing oils. That immensely high yield- which is predominantly what makes it so profitable – is potentially also an<b> ecological </b>benefit. If <b>ten times</b> more <b>palm oil</b> can be produced from a patch of land than any competing oil, then <b>ten times</b> more land would need to be cleared in order to produce the same volume of oil from that competitor.","As for the question of <b>carbon emissions</b>, the issue really depends on what <b>oil <b>palm trees</b></b> are replacing. Crops vary in the degree to which they<b> sequester </b>carbon – in other words, the <b>amount of carbon</b> they capture from the atmosphere and store within the plant. The more carbon a plant sequesters, the more it reduces the effect of <b>climate change</b>. As Shankar explains: ‘[<b>Palm oil</b> production] actually<b> sequesters </b>more carbon in <b><b>some way</b>s</b> than other alternatives. [… ] Of course, if you’re <b>cutting down</b><b> virgin </b>forest it’s terrible – that’s what’s happening in Indonesia and Malaysia, it’s been allowed to <b>get out of hand</b>. But if it’s replacing rice, for example, it might actually<b> sequester </b>more carbon.’","<b>G)</b>  The industry is now regulated by a <b>group called</b> the Roundtable on<b> Sustainable </b><b>Palm Oil</b> (RSPO), consisting of palm growers, retailers, product manufacturers, and other interested parties. Over the past decade or so, an agreement has gradually been reached regarding standards that producers of <b>palm oil</b> have to meet in order for their product to be regarded as officially ‘sustainable’. The RSPO insists upon no<b> virgin </b>forest clearing,<b> transparency </b>and regular assessment of carbon stocks, among other criteria. <b>Only once</b> these requirements are fully satisfied is the oil allowed to be sold as certified<b> sustainable </b><b>palm oil</b> (CSPO). Recent figures show that the RSPO now certifies around 12 <b>million tonnes</b> of <b>palm oil</b> annually, equivalent to roughly 21 percent of the world’s total <b>palm oil</b> production.","<b>H)</b>  There is even hope that <b>oil <b>palm plantations</b></b> might not need to be such<b> sterile </b>monocultures, or ‘green deserts’, as Ellwood describes them. <b>New research</b> at Ellwood’s lab hints at one plant which might make all the difference. The bird’s nest<b> fern </b>(Asplenium nidus) grows on trees in an epiphytic fashion (meaning it’s dependent on the tree only for support, not for nutrients), and is native to many tropical regions, where as a keyst<b>one species</b> it performs a vital<b> ecological </b>role. Ellwood believes that reintroducing the bird’s nest<b> fern </b>into <b>oil <b>palm plantations</b></b> could potentially allow these areas to recover their biodiversity, providing a home for all manner of species, from<b> fungi </b>and bacteria, to invertebrates such as insects, amphibians,<b> reptiles </b>and even mammals."]},{"name":"ARE/17-3-3","paragraph":["Building the Skyline: The Birth and Growth of Manhattan’s Skyscrapers","<b>READING PASSAGE</b> 3","You should spend about 20 <b>minutes on Questions</b> 27-40, which are <b><b>based on Reading</b> Passage</b> 3 below.","Building the Skyline: The Birth and Growth of Manhattan's<b> Skyscrapers </b><b><b>IELTS <b>Reading <b>answers explanation</b></b></b> PDF</b>","Source: Buildingtheskyline.org","Katharine L. Shester reviews a book by Jason Barr about the <b>development of New</b> York City","In Building the Skyline, Jason Barr takes the reader through a detailed history of <b>New York</b> City. The book combines geology, history, economics, and a lot of data to explain why business clusters developed where they did and how the early decisions of workers and firms shaped the skyline we see today. Building the Skyline is organized into two distinct parts. The first is primarily historical and addresses <b>New York</b>’s settlement and growth from 1609 to 1900; the second deals primarily with the 20th century and is a compilation of chapters commenting on <b>different aspects</b> of <b>New York</b>’s urban development. The tone and organization of the book changes somewhat between the first and second parts, as the<b> latter </b>chapters<b> incorporate </b>aspects of Barr’s related research papers.","Barr begins chapter one by taking the reader on a ‘helicopter time-machine’ ride – giving a fascinating account of how the <b>New York</b> landscape in 1609 might <b>have looked</b> from the sky. He then moves on to a subterranean walking tour of the city, indicating the location of rock and water below the subsoil, before taking the reader back to the surface. His love of the city comes through as he describes various fun facts about the location of the <b>New York</b><b> residence </b>of early 19th-century vice-president Aaron Burr as well as a number of legends about the city.","Chapters two and three take the reader up to the <b>Civil War</b> (1861-1865), with chapter two focusing on the early development of land and the implementation of a grid system in 1811. Chapter three focuses on <b>land use</b> before the <b>Civil War</b>. Both chapters are<b> informative </b>and well researched and set the stage for the economic analysis that comes later in the book. I would have liked Barr to expand upon his claim that existing tenements* prevented<b> skyscrapers </b>in certain<b> neighborhoods </b>because ‘likely no<b> skyscraper </b>developer was interested in performing the necessary “slum clearance”‘. Later in the book, Barr makes the claim that the depth of bedrock** was not a limiting factor for developers, as foundation costs were a small fraction of the cost of development. At first glance, it is not obvious why slum<b> clearance </b>would be limiting, while more expensive foundations would not.","Chapter four focuses on immigration and the location of<b> neighborhoods </b>and tenements in the late 19th century. Barr identifies four primary immigrant<b> enclaves </b>and analyzes their locations in terms of the amenities available in the area. Most of these<b> enclaves </b>were located on the least valuable land, between the industries located on the waterfront and the wealthy<b> neighborhoods </b>bordering <b>Central Park</b>.","Part two of the book begins with a discussion of the economics of<b> skyscraper </b>height. In chapter five, Barr distinguishes between engineering height, economic height, and developer height – where engineering height is the tallest building that can be safely made at a <b>given time</b>, economic height is the height that is <b>most efficient</b> from society’s <b>point of view</b>, and developer height is the actual height chosen by the developer, who is attempting to maximize return on investment.","Chapter five <b>also has</b> an interesting discussion of the technological advances that led to the construction of skyscrapers. For example, the introduction of iron and<b> steel </b>skeletal frames made thick, load-bearing walls unnecessary, expanding the usable square footage of buildings and increasing the use of windows and availability of natural light. Chapter six then presents data on building height throughout the 20th century and uses regression analysis to ‘predict’ building construction. While less technical than the research paper on which the chapter is based, it is probably more technical than would be<b> preferred </b>by a general audience.","Chapter seven<b> tackles </b>the ‘bedrock myth’, the assumption that the absence of bedrock close to the surface between Downtown and Midtown <b>New York</b> is the reason for<b> skyscrapers </b>not being built between the two urban centers. Rather, Barr argues that while deeper bedrock does increase foundation costs, these costs were neither<b> prohibitively </b>high nor were they large compared to the overall cost of building a skyscraper. What I enjoyed the most about this chapter was Barr’s discussion of how foundations are <b>actually built</b>. He describes the use of caissons, which enable workers to dig down for considerable distances, often below the water table, until they reach bedrock. Barr’s thorough technological history discusses not only how<b> caissons </b>work, but also the dangers involved. While this chapter<b> references </b>empirical research papers, it is a relatively easy read.","Chapters eight and nine focus on the birth of Midtown and the building boom of the 1920s. Chapter eight contains lengthy discussions of urban economic theory that may serve as a distraction to readers primarily interested in <b>New York</b>. However, they would be well-suited for undergraduates learning about the economics of cities. In the next chapter, Barr considers two of the primary explanations for the building boom of the 1920s – the first being exuberance, and the second being financing. He uses data to assess the viability of these two explanations and finds that supply and demand factors explain much of the development of the 1920s; though it enabled the boom, cheap credit was not, he argues, the primary cause.","In the final chapter (chapter 10), Barr discusses another of his<b> empirical </b>papers that<b> estimates </b>Manhattan land values from the mid-19th century to the <b>present day</b>. The data work that went into these estimations is particularly impressive. Toward the end of the chapter, Barr assesses ‘whether<b> skyscrapers </b>are a cause or an effect of high land values’. He finds that changes in land values predict future building height, but the reverse is not true. The book ends with an epilogue, in which Barr discusses the impact of <b>climate change</b> on the city and makes policy suggestions for <b>New York</b> <b>going forward</b>."]},{"name":"ARE/17-4-1","paragraph":["<h2>Bats to the rescue</h2>","<b>READING PASSAGE</b> 1","You should spend about 20 <b>minutes on Questions</b> 1-13, which are <b><b>based on Reading</b> Passage</b> 1 below.","Bats to the rescue <b><b>ielts <b>reading <b>answers explanation</b></b></b> pdf</b>","Source: https://www.cam.ac.uk/batstotherescue","How Madagascar’s bats are helping to save the rainforest","There are few <b>places in the world</b> where relations between agriculture and conservation are more strained. Madagascar’s forests are being converted to agricultural land at a rate of one percent <b>every year</b>. Much of this destruction is<b> fuelled </b>by the<b> cultivation </b>of the country’s main<b> staple </b>crop: rice. And a key reason for this destruction is that insect pests are destroying vast quantities of what is grown by local<b> subsistence </b>farmers, leading them to clear forest to create new<b> paddy </b>fields. The result is<b> devastating </b>habitat and biodiversity loss on the island, but not all<b> species </b>are suffering. In fact, some of the island’s<b> insectivorous </b>bats are currently thriving and this has important implications for farmers and<b> conservationists </b>alike.","Enter <b>University of Cambridge</b> zoologist Ricardo Rocha. He’s passionate about conservation, and bats. More specifically, he’s interested in how bats are responding to human activity and<b> deforestation </b>in particular. Rocha’s new study shows that several<b> species </b>of bats are giving Madagascar’s rice farmers a vital pest control service by feasting on plagues of insects. And this, he believes, can ease the financial pressure on farmers to turn forest into fields.","Bats<b> comprise </b>roughly one-fifth of all mammal<b> species </b>in Madagascar and thirty-six recorded bat<b> species </b>are native to the island, making it <b>one of the most</b> important regions for conservation of this animal group anywhere in the world.","Co-leading an <b>international team</b> of scientists, Rocha found that several<b> species </b>of<b> indigenous </b>bats are taking advantage of habitat modification to hunt insects<b> swarming </b>above the country’s <b>rice fields</b>. They include the Malagasy mouse-eared bat, Major’s long-fingered bat, the Malagasy white-bellied free-tailed<b> bat </b>and Peters’ wrinkle-lipped bat.","‘These winner<b> species </b>are providing a valuable free service to Madagascar as biological pest suppressors,’ says Rocha. ‘We found that six<b> species </b>of<b> bat </b>are<b> preying </b>on rice pests, including the paddy<b> swarming </b>caterpillar and grass webworm. The damage which these insects cause puts the island’s farmers under huge financial pressure and that encourages deforestation.’","The study, now <b>published in the journal</b> Agriculture, Ecosystems and Environment, set out to investigate the feeding activity of<b> insectivorous </b>bats in the farmland bordering the Ranomafana <b>National Park</b> in the southeast of the country.","Rocha and his team used state-of-the-art ultrasonic recorders to record over a thousand<b> bat </b>‘feeding buzzes’ (echolocation sequences used by bats to target their prey) at 54 sites, in order to identify the favourite feeding spots of the bats. They next used DNA barcoding techniques to analyse droppings collected from bats at the different sites.","The recordings revealed that<b> bat </b>activity over <b>rice fields</b> was <b>much higher</b> than it was in continuous forest – seven times higher over <b>rice fields</b> which were on flat ground, and sixteen times higher over fields on the sides of hills – leaving <b>no doubt</b> that the animals are preferentially foraging in these man-made ecosystems. The researchers suggest that the bats favour these fields because lack of water and nutrient run-off make these crops more<b> susceptible </b>to insect pest infestations. DNA analysis showed that all six<b> species </b>of<b> bat </b>had fed on economically important insect pests. While the findings indicated that rice farming benefits most from the bats, the scientists <b>also found</b> indications that the bats were consuming pests of other crops, including the black twig borer (which infests coffee plants), the sugarcane cicada, the macadamia nut-borer, and the sober tabby (a pest of citrus fruits).","‘The effectiveness of bats as pest controllers <b>has already</b> been proven in the USA and Catalonia,’ said co-author James Kemp, from the University of Lisbon. ‘But our study is the first to show this happening in Madagascar, where the stakes for both farmers and<b> conservationists </b>are so high.’","<b>Local people</b> may have a further reason to be grateful to their bats. While the animal is often associated with spreading disease, Rocha and his team <b>found evidence</b> that Malagasy bats feed not just on crop pests but also on<b> mosquitoes </b>– carriers of malaria, Rift Valley fever virus and elephantiasis – as well as blackflies, which spread river blindness.","Rocha points out that the relationship is complicated. When food is scarce, bats become a crucial <b>source of protein</b> for <b>local people</b>. Even the children will hunt them. And as well as roosting in trees, the bats sometimes roost in buildings, but are not welcomed there because they make them unclean. At the <b>same time</b>, however, they are associated with<b> sacred </b>caves and the ancestors, so they can be viewed as beings between worlds, which makes them very significant in the culture of the people. And <b>one potential</b> problem is that while these bats are benefiting from farming, at the <b>same time</b><b> deforestation </b>is reducing the places where they can roost, which could <b>have long</b>-term effects on their numbers. Rocha says, ‘With the right help, we hope that farmers can promote this mutually beneficial relationship by installing<b> bat </b>houses.’","Rocha and his colleagues believe that maximising<b> bat </b>populations can help to boost <b>crop yields</b> and promote<b> sustainable </b>livelihoods. The <b>team is now</b> calling for <b>further research</b> to quantify this contribution. ‘I’m very optimistic,’ says Rocha. ‘If we give nature a hand, we can speed up the process of regeneration.’"]},{"name":"ARE/17-4-2","paragraph":["<h2>Does education fuel economic growth?</h2>","<b>READING PASSAGE</b> 2","You should spend about 20 <b>minutes on Questions</b> 14-26, which are <b><b>based on Reading</b> Passage</b> 2 below.","does education<b> fuel </b><b>economic growth</b> <b><b>ielts <b>reading <b>answers explanation</b></b></b> pdf</b>","Source: Policyed.org","<b>A)</b>  Over the last decade, a huge database about the lives of southwest German villagers between 1600 and 1900 has been compiled by a <b>team led</b> by Professor Sheilagh Ogilvie at Cambridge University’s Faculty of Economics. It includes court records, guild ledgers, parish registers, village censuses, tax lists and – the most recent addition – 9,000 handwritten inventories listing over a million personal possessions belonging to ordinary <b>women and men</b> across three centuries. Ogilvie, who discovered the inventories in the archives of two German communities 30 <b>years ago</b>, believes they may hold the answer to a conundrum that <b>has long</b> puzzled economists: the lack of evidence for a causal link between education and a country’s <b>economic growth</b>.","<b>B)</b>  As Ogilvie explains, ‘Education helps us to work more productively, invent better technology, and earn more … surely it must be critical for <b>economic growth</b>? But, if you <b>look back</b> through history, there’s <b>no evidence</b> that having a high literacy rate made a country<b> industrialise </b>earlier.’ Between 1600 and 1900, England had only mediocre literacy rates by European standards, yet its economy grew fast and it was the first country to industrialise. During this period, Germany and Scandinavia had<b> excellent </b>literacy rates, but their economies grew slowly and they<b> industrialised </b>late. ‘Modern cross-country analyses <b>have also</b> struggled to find evidence that education causes <b>economic growth</b>, <b>even though</b> there is <b>plenty of evidence</b> that growth increases education,’ she adds.","<b>C)</b>  In the handwritten inventories that Ogilvie is analysing are the belongings of <b>women and men</b> at marriage, remarriage and death. From badger skins to Bibles,<b> sewing </b>machines to scarlet bodices – the villagers’ entire worldly goods are included. Inventories of agricultural equipment and<b> craft </b>tools reveal economic activities; ownership of books and education­ related objects like pens and slates suggests how people learned. In addition, the tax lists included in the database record the value of farms, workshops, assets and debts; signatures and people’s<b> estimates </b>of their age indicate literacy and<b> numeracy </b>levels; and court records reveal obstacles (such as the activities of the guilds*) that<b> stifled </b>industry.","Previous studies usually had <b>just one</b> way of linking education with <b>economic growth</b> – the presence of schools and printing presses, perhaps, or school enrolment, or the ability to sign names. According to Ogilvie, the database provides multiple indicators for the same individuals, making it possible to analyse links between literacy, numeracy, wealth, and industriousness, for individual <b>women and men</b> over the <b>long term</b>.","<b>D)</b>  Ogilvie and her team have been building the vast database of material possessions on top of their full<b> demographic </b>reconstruction of the people who lived in these two German communities. ‘We can follow the same people – and their<b> descendants </b>– across 300 years of educational and economic change,’ she says. Individual <b>lives have</b> unfolded before their eyes. <b>Stories like</b> that of the 24-year-olds Ana Regina and Magdalena Riethmiillerin, who were chastised in 1707 for reading books in church <b>instead of listening</b> to the sermon. ‘This tells us they were continuing to develop their reading skills at least a decade after leaving school,’ explains Ogilvie. The database also reveals the case of Juliana Schweickherdt, a SO-year-old spinster living in the small Black Forest community of Wildberg, who was reprimanded in 1752 by the local weavers’ guild for ‘weaving cloth and combing wool, counter to the guild ordinance’. When Juliana continued taking jobs reserved for male guild members, she was summoned before the guild court and told to pay a fine equivalent to one third of a servant’s annual wage. It was a small act of defiance by today’s standards, but it reflects a time when laws in Germany and elsewhere regulated people’s access to<b> labour </b>markets. The<b> dominance </b>of guilds not only prevented people from <b>using their skills</b>, but also <b>held back</b> even the simplest<b> industrial </b>innovation.","<b>E)</b>  The data-gathering phase of the <b>project has</b> been completed and now, according to Ogilvie, it is time ‘to ask the big questions’. <b>One way</b> to look at whether education causes <b>economic growth</b> is to ‘hold wealth constant’. This involves following the lives of <b>different people</b> with the same level of wealth over a <b>period of time</b>. If wealth is constant, it is possible to discover whether education was, for example, linked to the<b> cultivation </b>of new crops, or to the adoption of<b> industrial </b>innovations like<b> sewing </b>machines. The team will also ask what aspect of education helped people engage more with productive and innovative activities. Was it, for instance, literacy, numeracy, book ownership, years of schooling? Was there a threshold level – a tipping point – that needed to be reached to affect economic performance?","<b>F)</b>  Ogilvie hopes to start finding answers to these questions over the <b>next <b>few years</b></b>. <b>One thing</b> is already clear, she says: the relationship between education and <b>economic growth</b> is far from straightforward. ‘German-speaking central Europe is an excellent<b> laboratory </b>for testing theories of <b>economic growth</b>,’ she explains. Between 1600 and 1900, literacy rates and book ownership were high and yet the region remained poor. It was also the case that local guilds and merchant associations were extremely powerful and legislated against anything that undermined their monopolies. In villages throughout the region, guilds blocked<b> labour </b>migration and<b> resisted </b>changes that might reduce their influence.","‘Early findings suggest that the potential benefits of education for the economy can be <b>held back</b> by other barriers, and this has implications for today,’ says Ogilvie. ‘Huge amounts are spent improving education in <b>developing countries</b>, but this spending can fail to deliver <b>economic growth</b> if restrictions block people – especially women and the poor – from using their education in economically productive ways. If economic institutions are poorly <b>set up</b>, for instance, education can’t lead to growth.’"]},{"name":"ARE/17-4-3","paragraph":["<h2>Timur Gareyev – Blindfold Chess Champion</h2>","<b>READING PASSAGE</b> 3","You should spend about 20 <b>minutes on Questions</b> 27-40, which are <b><b>based on Reading</b> Passage</b> 3 below.","TimurGareyev <b>blindfold chess</b> champion <b><b>ielts <b>reading <b>answers explanation</b></b></b> pdf</b>","Source: Wikipedia","<b>A)</b>  <b>Next month</b>, a chess player named Timur Gareyev will take on nearly 50 opponents at once. But that is not the <b>hard part</b>. While his challengers will play the games as normal, Gareyev himself will be blindfolded. Even by world record standards, it sets a high bar for human performance. The 28-year-old already stands out in the rarefied world of <b>blindfold chess</b>. He has a fondness for bright clothes and<b> unusual </b>hairstyles, and he gets his kicks from the adventure sport of BASE jumping. He <b>has already</b> proved himself a strong chess player, too. In a 10-hour chess<b> marathon </b>in 2013, Gareyev played 33 games in his head simultaneously. He won 29 and lost none. The skill <b>has become</b> his brand: he calls himself the<b> Blindfold </b>King.","<b>B)</b>  But Gareyev’s prowess has drawn interest from beyond the chess-playing community. In the hope of understanding how he and others <b>like him</b> can perform such mental feats, researchers at the University of California in <b>Los Angeles</b> (UCLA) called him in for tests. They <b>now have</b> their first results. ‘The ability to <b>play a game</b> of chess with your eyes closed is not a far reach for most accomplished players,’ said Jesse Rissman, who runs a memory lab at UCLA. ‘But the thing that’s so remarkable about Timur and a <b>few other</b> individuals is the number of games they can keep active at once. To me it is simply astonishing.’","<b>C)</b>  Gareyev <b>learned to play</b> chess in his native Uzbekistan when he was <b>six years</b> old. Tutored by his grandfather, he entered his first tournament aged eight and soon became<b> obsessed </b>with competitions. At 16, he was<b> crowned </b>Asia’s youngest ever chess grandmaster. He moved to the US soon after, and as a student helped his university win its first national chess championship. In 2013, Gareyev was ranked the third best chess player in the US.","<b>D)</b>  To the uninitiated, <b>blindfold chess</b> seems to call for superhuman skill. But displays of the feat <b>go back</b> centuries. The first recorded game in Europe was played in 13th-century Florence. In 1947, the Argentinian<b> grandmaster </b>Miguel Najdorf played 45 simultaneous games in his mind, winning 39 in the 24-hour session.","<b>E)</b>  Accomplished players can develop the skill of playing<b> blind </b>even without realising it. The nature of the game is to run through possible moves in the mind to see how they play out. From this, regular players develop a memory for the patterns the pieces make, the defences and attacks. ‘You<b> recreate </b>it in your mind,’ said Gareyev. ‘A lot of players are capable of doing what I’m doing.’ The real mental challenge comes from playing multiple games at once in the head. Not only must the positions of each piece on every board be memorised, they must be recalled faithfully when needed, updated with each player’s moves, and then reliably stored again, so the brain can move on to the next board. First moves can be tough to remember because they are fairly uninteresting. But the ends of games are taxing too, as exhaustion sets in. When Gareyev is tired, his recall can get patchy. He sometimes makes moves based on only a fragmented memory of the pieces’ positions.","<b>F)</b>  The scientists <b>first had</b> Gareyev perform some standard memory tests. These assessed his ability to hold numbers, pictures and words in mind. One classic test measures how many numbers a person can repeat, both forwards and backwards, soon after hearing them. Most <b>people manage</b> about seven. ‘He was not exceptional on any of these standard tests,’ said Rissman. ‘We didn’t find <b>anything other</b> than playing chess that he seems to be<b> supremely </b>gifted at.’ But next came the brain scans. With Gareyev lying down in the machine, Rissman looked at how well connected the various regions of the chess player’s brain were. Though the results are tentative and as yet unpublished, the scans found <b>much greater</b> than average communication between parts of Gareyev’s brain that <b>make up</b> what is called the frontoparietal control network. Of 63 people scanned alongside the chess player, only <b>one or two</b> scored more highly on the measure. ‘You use this network in <b>almost any</b> complex task. It helps you to allocate attention, keep rules in mind, and work out whether you should be responding or not,’ said Rissman.","<b>G)</b>  It was not the only hint of <b>something special</b> in Gareyev’s brain. The scans also suggest that Gareyev’s visual network is more highly connected to other brain parts than usual. Initial <b>results suggest</b> that the areas of his brain that process visual images – such as chess boards – may have stronger links to other brain regions, and so be more powerful than normal. While the analyses are not finalised yet, they may hold the first clues to Gareyev’s extraordinary ability.","<b>H)</b>  For the world record attempt, Gareyev hopes to play 47<b> blindfold </b>games at once in about 16 hours. He will need to win 80% to claim the title. ‘I don’t <b><b>worry too</b> much</b> about the winning percentage, that’s never been an issue for me,’ he said. ‘The <b>most <b>important part</b></b> of <b>blindfold chess</b> for me is that I <b>have found</b> the <b>one thing</b> that I can fully dedicate myself to.

It’s £429 (Q9) <b>per person</b>, which is a good deal.","ANDREA:             So that covers accommodation and car hire. What about flights?","TRAVEL AGENT:   They aren’t included.

My name’s Sandy Fisher and I’m one of the fitness managers here. Before we <b>start our tour</b> of the club I’ll <b>just <b>run through some</b></b> basic information about the<b> facilities </b>we have here, including recent improvements, and explain the <b>types of membership</b> available.","Our <b>greatest asset</b> is probably our <b>swimming pool</b> which at 25 metres isn’t Olympic-sized, but now we’ve expanded it to eight lanes, it’s <b>much wider</b> (Q11&Q12). This means there are rarely more than a <b>couple of people</b> at a <b>time in each</b> lane. Unfortunately, there isn’t space for an outdoor pool here but the glass roof on the <b>swimming pool</b> is partly retractable, which means you can enjoy something of the open-air experience on warmer days.","Our recently<b> refurbished </b><b>fitness suite</b> (Q11&Q12) <b>has all</b> the latest exercise equipment including ten new running machines, and a <b>wide range</b> of weight-training machines. Each member is <b>given full</b> training in how to operate the equipment and there is always a<b> trainer </b>on duty to offer help and advice. Although we <b>do have</b> adult-only times after 6 and at certain times at weekends, children are well<b> catered </b>for. <b>Older children</b> continue to benefit from a <b>wide range</b> of tuition; anything from<b> trampolining </b>to yoga.","——————–","<b>One thing</b> all our members appreciate about us is that we take very <b>good care</b> of them. This starts on <b>day one</b> with your personal assessment. You are asked to fill in a questionnaire giving details of any <b>health problems</b> (Q13). One of our <b>personal trainer</b>s will then go through this with you.","The<b> trainer </b>will then take you through the <b>safety rules</b> (Q14) for using the equipment in the <b>fitness suite</b>. During your next exercise session a <b>personal trainer</b> will work with you to <b>make <b>sure you understand</b></b> these. It’s <b>very important</b> to do this because we <b>really do</b> <b>want to avoid</b> <b>having any</b> sports injuries. There’s a lot more to looking after yourself than simply lifting weights!","At the end of the personal assessment, the<b> trainer </b>will <b>draw up</b> a plan, outlining what you should try to achieve within a six-week period (Q15). This will then be reviewed at the end of the <b>six weeks</b>.","Now, I’ll just quickly run through the <b>types of membership</b> we have available. All members must pay a joining fee of £90 (Q16) in addition to the rates for the monthly membership fees. <b>Gold membership</b><b> entitles </b>you to free entry at all <b>LP Clubs</b> (Q17). There are now <b>LP clubs</b> in all <b>major cities</b> and towns so if you travel a lot will be a great advantage. Individual <b>gold membership</b> costs £50 a month and joint membership for you and your partner will cost £75.","<b><b>Premier members</b>hip</b> is for professional people whose work commitments <b>make it difficult</b> for them to use the club <b>during the day</b> and so LP gives booking preferences to <b>Premier members</b> at peak times (Q18). This means you will <b>find it easier</b> to book the sessions at times that suit you. Reciprocal arrangements with other <b>LP Clubs</b> are available to <b>Premier members</b>. <b><b>Premier members</b>hip</b> is for individuals only, but you will be sent passes for guests <b>every month</b> (Q19). The monthly fee is £65.","You don’t <b>have to have</b> <b>any special</b> clothes or equipment when you visit the club. We provide<b> robes </b>and<b> hairdryers </b>in the changing rooms, but it’s <b>very important</b> to remember your photo card (Q20) because you won’t be <b>able to get</b> in without it.","For people who aren’t working <b>during the day</b> then …","#3 <b>Global <b>Design Competition</b></b> Transcript","The Part 3 <b>audio transcript</b> of <b>Global <b>Design Competition</b></b> in Cambridge 10 <b>Listening Test</b> 1 is as follows:","JOHN:                   Erm … hello Professor, I’m John Wishart. I’m working on my entry for the <b>Global <b>Design Competition</b></b>. My tutor said you might be <b>able to help</b> me with it.","PROFESSOR:       Ah, yes, I got a copy of your drawings. Come in and <b>tell me</b> about it. What sort of competition is it?","JOHN:                   Well, it’s an international <b>design competition</b> and we <b>have to come</b> up with a <b>new design</b> for a typical domestic <b>kitchen appliance</b>. (Q21)","PROFESSOR:       I see, and are there <b>any special</b> conditions? <b>Does it have</b> to save energy for example?","JOHN:                   Actually that was the focus in <b>last year</b>’s competition. This year’s different. We have to adopt an innovative approach to existing technology, using it in a way that hasn’t been thought of before.","PROFESSOR:       I see, that sounds tricky. And what <b>kitchen appliance</b> have you chosen?","JOHN:                   Well, they’re an everyday <b>kitchen appliance</b> in most Australian houses but they’re all pretty boring and almost identical to <b>each other</b>. I think <b>some people</b> will be prepared to pay a little extra for something that looks different. (Q22)","PROFESSOR:       That’s a nice idea. I see you’ve called your design ‘the Rockpool’; why is that?","JOHN:                   Basically because it <b>looks like</b> the <b>rock pools</b> you find on a beach. The top is made of glass so that you can <b>look down</b> into it.","PROFESSOR:       And there’s a stone at the bottom. Is that just for decoration?","JOHN:                   Actually it <b>does have</b> a function. Instead of pushing a button, you turn the stone. (Q23)","PROFESSOR:       So it’s <b>really just</b> a novel way of starting the dishwasher.","JOHN:                   That’s right.","PROFESSOR:       It’s a <b>really nice</b> design, but what makes it innovative?","JOHN:                   Well, I decided to make a dishwasher that uses <b>carbon dioxide</b>.","PROFESSOR:       In place of water and detergent? How will you manage that?","JOHN:                   The idea is to<b> pressurize </b>the <b>carbon dioxide</b> so that it becomes a liquid. The fluid is then released into the dishwasher where it cleans the dishes all by itself.","PROFESSOR:       <b>Sounds like</b> a brilliant idea! Your system will totally do away with the need for strong detergents. So what happens once the dishes are clean?","JOHN:                   Well, to allow them to dry, the liquid <b>carbon dioxide</b> and the waste materials all go to an area called the holding chamber. That’s where the liquid is<b> depressurised </b>and so it reverts to a gas (Q24). Then the oil and<b> grease </b>are<b> separated </b>out and sent to the waste system.","PROFESSOR:       It <b>sounds like</b> you’ve thought it all out very thoroughly. So, what happens to the <b>carbon dioxide</b> once the process is complete? Not wasted I hope.","JOHN:                   Actually, that’s where the real savings are made. The <b>carbon dioxide</b> is sent back to the<b> cylinder </b>and can be used again and again. (Q25)","PROFESSOR:       What a<b> terrific </b>idea. <b>Do you think</b> it will ever be built?","JOHN:                   Probably not, but that’s OK.","PROFESSOR:       Well, I’m sure a lot of <b>positive things</b> will come out of your design.","——————————-","PROFESSOR:       Now, you seem to <b>have thought</b> about everything so what exactly did you <b>need me</b> to help you with?","JOHN:                   Well, my <b>design has</b> made it to the <b>final stage</b> of the competition and, in a <b>few months</b>’ time. I <b>have to give</b> a presentation, and that’s the part I was<b> hoping </b>you could <b>help me</b> with. (Q26)","PROFESSOR:       Right, well that should be <b>easy enough</b>. What have you managed to do so far?","JOHN:                   Well, I’ve got detailed drawings to show how it will work and I’ve also written a 500-word paper on it.","PROFESSOR:       I see. Well, if you want to stand a <b>good chance</b> of winning you <b>really need</b> a model of the machine. (Q27)","JOHN:                   Yes, I thought I might but I’m having a few problems.","PROFESSOR:       What is the main difficulty so far? <b>Let <b>me guess</b></b> – is it the materials?","JOHN:                   Yes. I want it to look professional but everything that’s top quality is also <b>very expensive</b>. (Q28)","PROFESSOR:       Look, projects like this are <b>very important</b> to us. They really help lift our profile. So why don’t you talk to the university about a grant? (Q29) I can help you fill out the <b><b>application form</b>s</b> if you like.","JOHN:                   That would be a great.","PROFESSOR:       You’d better show me this paper you’ve written as well. For a global competition such as this you <b><b>need to make</b> sure</b> the technical details you’ve given are accurate and thorough.

One in ten black bears is <b>actually born</b> with a white coat, which is the result of a special gene that surfaces in a few (Q31).","<b>Local people</b> <b>have named</b> it ‘the <b>spirit bear</b>’. And according to the legends of these communities, its snowy fur brings with it a special power (Q32). Because of this, it <b>has always</b> been <b>highly regarded</b> by them – so much that they do not speak of seeing it to anyone else. It is their way of protecting it when strangers visit the area. (Q33)","The white bear’s habitat is <b>quite interesting</b>. The bear’s strong relationship with the old-growth rainforest is a complex one. The white bear relies on the huge centuries-old trees in the forest in <b>many ways</b>. For example, the old-growth <b>trees have</b> extremely long roots that help prevent erosion of the soil along the banks of the <b>many fish</b> streams (Q34).","Keeping these banks intact is <b>important because</b> these streams are home to salmon, which are the bear’s main food source. In return, the bear’s feeding habits nurture the forest. As the bears eat the salmon, they discard the skin and bones in great amounts on the forest floor, which provide vital nutrients. These produce lush<b> vegetation </b>that<b> sustains </b>thousands of <b>other types</b> of life forms, from birds to insects and more.","Today, the <b>spirit bear</b> lives off the coast of the province of <b>British Columbia</b> on a few islands (Q35). There is great concern for their survival since it is<b> estimated </b>that less than <b>two hundred</b> of these white bears remain. The <b>best way</b> to protect them is to <b>make every</b> effort to<b> preserve </b>the <b>delicate balance</b> of their forest environment – in other words, their ecosystem.","———————–","The greatest threat to the bear’s existence is the loss of its habitat. Over many years, <b>logging companies</b> have<b> stripped </b>the land by <b>cutting down</b> a large <b>number of trees</b>. In addition, they <b>have built</b> roads which have<b> fractured </b>the areas where the bear usually feeds, and many hibernation sites <b>have also</b> been lost (Q36).","The logging of the trees along the streams has damaged the places where the bears fish. To make matters worse, the number of<b> salmon </b>in those streams is declining because there is no legal limit on fishing at the moment. (Q37)","all these influences have a negative impact on the <b>spirit bear</b>’s very existence, which is made all the more fragile by the fact that reproduction among these bears <b>has always</b> been disappointingly low. (Q38)","And so, what’s the situation <b>going forward</b>? Community organizations, environmental groups and the <b>British Columbia</b> government are now <b>working together</b> on the problem. The government is now requiring <b>logging companies</b> to adopt a better logging method (Q39), which is a positive step. However, these measures alone may not be sufficient to ensure a healthy population of the <b>spirit bear</b> in the future.","Other steps <b>also need</b> to be taken. While it is important to maintain the <b>spirit bear</b>’s habitat, there <b><b>also need</b>s</b> to be more<b> emphasis </b>on its expansion (Q40). The move is justified as it will also create space for other bears that are losing their homes …"]},{"name":"GLS/10-2","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Transport Survey Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of <b>Transport Survey</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 2 is as follows:","INTERVIEWER:   Excuse me.","LUISA:                  Yes?","INTERVIEWER:   I wonder if you could <b>spare a <b>few minutes</b></b> to do a survey on transport.

I’m very <b>pleased to have</b> this opportunity to <b>say a little</b> about two <b>exciting new</b> developments in the city: the Brackenside Open-Air <b>Swimming Pool</b> and the children’s <b>Adventure Playground</b> in <b>Central Park</b>. As many of you may know, the idea for these initiatives came from you, the public (Q11), in the extensive consultation exercise which the <b>City Council</b> conducted <b>last year</b>. And they have been realised using money from the SWRDC – the South West Regional Development Commission.","<b>First of all</b>, Brackenside Pool. As many of the older <b>members of the audience</b> will remember, there used to be a wonderful open-air pool on the sea front 30 <b>years ago</b> but it had to close when it was judged to be unsafe. For the design of this new heated pool, we were <b>very happy</b> to secure the talents of internationally<b> renowned </b>architect Ellen Wendon, who <b>has managed</b> to combine a charming 1930s design, which fits is so well with <b>many of the other</b> buildings in the area, with up-to-the-minute features such as a<b> recycling </b>system – the <b>only one</b> of its kind in the world – which enables<b> seawater </b>to be used in the pool. (Q12)","Now, there has been <b>quite a bit</b> of discussion in the local press about whether there would be enough room for the <b>number of visitors</b> we’re<b> hoping </b>to attract (Q13), but the design is deceptive and there have been<b> rigorous </b>checks about capacity. Also, just in case you were wondering, we’re on schedule for a June 15th <b>opening date</b> and well within budget: a<b> testimony </b>to the <b>excellent work</b> of local contractors Hickman’s.","We hope that as <b>many <b>people as possible</b></b> will be there on June 15th. We have engaged award-winning actress Coral White to declare the pool open and there’ll be <b>drinks and snacks</b> available at the pool side. There’ll also be a competition for the public to decide on the<b> sculpture </b>we plan to have at the entrance: you will decide which famous historical figure from the city we should have. (Q14)","————————","And now, moving on the <b>Central Park</b> Playground, which we’re pleased to announce <b>has just</b> won the Douglas Award for safety: the <b>news came</b> through only <b>last week</b>. The unique design is based on the concept of the Global Village, with the playground being divided into sex areas showing <b>different <b>parts of the world</b></b> – each with a<b> representative </b>feature. For example, there is a section on Asia, and this is represented by rides and equipment in the shape of snakes, orang-utans, tigers and so on –<b> fauna </b>native to the forests of the region (Q15).","<b>Moving south</b> to the Antarctic – we couldn’t run to an ice<b> rink </b>I’m afraid but<b> opted </b>instead for climbing blocks in the shape of mountains (Q16) – I thought they could <b>have had</b> slides for the<b> glaciers </b>but the designers did <b>want to avoid</b> being too literal! Then on to <b>South America</b> – and here the theme is El Dorado – games<b> replicating </b>the search for mines full of<b> precious </b>stones (Q17).","And then <b>moving up</b> to <b>North America</b>, here there was considerable debate – I know the contribution of cinema and jazz was considered but the designers finally<b> opted </b>for rockets and the international Space Station (Q18). Eastwards to Europe then, and <b>perhaps the most</b> traditional choice of all the areas:<b> medieval </b>castles and other<b> fortifications </b>(Q19).","Then last, but not least, <b>moving south</b> to Africa and a whole set of wonderful<b> mosaics </b>and<b> trails </b>to represent the great rivers of this fascinating and varied continent. (Q20)","Now, the <b>opening date</b> for our Global Playground is 10th July. And again we’d love to see you there – so make a date and <b>come and see</b> this magnificent, original new amenity right in the heart of the city.","#3 <b>Thor Heyerdahl</b> Transcript","The Part 3 <b>audio transcript</b> of <b>Thor Heyerdahl</b> in Cambridge 10 <b>Listening Test</b> 2 is as follows:","VICTOR:               Right, well, for our presentation shall I start with the early life of <b>Thor Heyerdahl</b>?","OLIVIA:                Sure. Why don’t you begin with describing the type of boy he was, especially his passion for collecting things. (Q21&Q22)","VICTOR:               That’s right, he had his own the little museum. And I think it’s<b> unusual </b>for children to develop their own values and not join in their parents’ hobbies; I’m thinking of how Heyerdahl wouldn’t go<b> hunting </b>with his dad, for example.","OLIVIA:                Yeah, he<b> preferred </b>to learn about nature by listening to his mother read to him. And quite early on he knew he wanted to become an<b> explorer </b>when he <b>grew up</b>. That came from his camping trips he went on in Norway I think …","VICTOR:               No, it was climbing that he spent his time on as a <b>young man</b>. (Q21&Q22)","OLIVIA:                Oh, right … After university he married a classmate and together, they decided to experience living on a <b>small island</b>, to find out how harsh <b>weather conditions</b> shaped people’s lifestyles. (Q23&Q24)","VICTOR:               As part of their preparation before they left home, they<b> learnt </b>basic survival skills <b>like building</b> a shelter. I guess they needed that knowledge in order to live wild in a remote location with few inhabitants, cut of by the sea, which is what they were aiming to do.","OLIVIA:                An <b>important part</b> of your talk should be the<b> radical </b>theory Heyerdahl formed from examining<b> mysterious </b>ancient carvings that he happened to find on the island. I think you should finish with that.","VICTOR:               OK.","————————-","OLIVIA:                <b>All right</b>, Victor, so after your part I’ll talk about <b>Thor Heyerdahl</b>’s adult life, continuing from the theory he had about Polynesian migration: <b>Up until</b> that time of course, academics had believed that humans first migrated to the islands in Polynesia from Asia, in the west.","VICTOR:               Yes, they thought that travel from the east was impossible, because of the huge, empty stretch of ocean that lies between the islands and the nearest<b> inhabited </b>land. (Q25)","OLIVIA:                Yes, but Heyerdahl spent ages studying the cloud movements, ocean currents and wind patterns to find if it was actually possible. And another argument was that there was no tradition of large ship-building in the communities lying to the east of Polynesia. But Heyerdahl knew they made lots of coastal<b> voyages </b>in locally <b>built canoes</b>.","VICTOR:               Yes, or sailing on rafts, as was shown by the long<b> voyage </b>that Heyerdahl did next. It was an incredibly risky journey to undertake – sometimes I wonder if he did that trip for private reasons, you know? To show others that he could have<b> spectacular </b>adventures. What <b>do you think</b>, Olivia?","OLIVIA:                Well, I think it was more a matter of simply trying out his idea, to see if migration from the east was possible. (Q26)","VICTOR:               Yes, that’s probably it. And the poor guy suffered a bit at that <b>time because</b> the war <b>forced him</b> to stop his <b>work for some</b> years …","OLIVIA:                Yes. When he got started again and planned his<b> epic </b>voyage, <b>do you think</b> it was important to him that he achieve it before anyone else did?","VICTOR:               Um, I haven’t <b>read any</b>where that that was his motivation. The most <b>important factor</b> <b>seems to have</b> been that he <b>use only</b> ancient techniques and local materials to build his raft. (Q27)","OLIVIA:                Yes. I wonder how fast it went.","VICTOR:               Well, it took them 97 days from <b>South America</b> to the <b>Pacific Island</b>.","OLIVIA:                Mm. And after that, Heyerdahl went to <b>Easter Island</b>, didn’t he? We should mention the purpose of that trip. I think he sailed there in a boat made out of reeds.","VICTOR:               No, that was later on in Egypt, Olivia.","OLIVIA:                Oh, yes, that’s right.","VICTOR:               But what he <b>wanted to do</b> was talk to the <b>local people</b> about their old stone carvings and then make one himself to learn more about the process. (Q28)","OLIVIA:                I see. Well, what a great life. <b>Even though</b> many of his <b>theories have</b> been disproven, he certainly left a lasting impression on many disciplines, didn’t he? To my mind, he was <b>first person</b> to establish what modern academics call practical archaeology. I mean, that they try to<b> recreate </b>something from the past today (Q29), like he did with his<b> raft </b>trip. It’s unfortunate that his ideas about where Polynesians<b> originated </b>from <b>have been completely</b> discredited.","VICTOR:               Yes. Right, well, I’ll prepare a PowerPoint slide at the end that acknowledges our sources. I mainly used The Life and Work of <b>Thor Heyerdahl</b> by William Oliver. The research methods he used were very sound, although I must say I found the overall tone somewhat old-fashioned. I think they <b>need to do</b> a new, revised edition.

And what I’m going to present in this<b> seminar </b>is a <b>few ideas</b> about how the activity is <b>likely to change</b> in the <b>next <b>ten years</b></b>. It isn’t a scientific,<b> statistical </b>analysis – just <b><b>some idea</b>s</b> for us to discuss.","<b>One area</b> I <b>want to mention</b> is business markets, and I’m sure a really significant development will be a major increase in competition, with companies from all <b>round the world</b> <b>trying to sell</b> similar products (Q31). Consumers will <b>have much</b> more choice – for instance, <b>food products</b> sold in Australia might be manufactured in the USA, China, Finland and dozens of <b>other countries</b>. At the <b>same time</b>, mergers and takeovers mean that governments are actually losing power to major global<b> corporations </b>(Q32).","We can <b>probably all</b> think of companies that exert a <b>great deal</b> of influence, which may be good for consumers. A third point I <b>want to make</b> about markets is that in the rapidly expanding economies, such as India, China, Brazil and Russia, demand is growing <b>very fast</b> (Q33). This is putting pressure on resources <b>all over the world</b>.","<b>I </b> think businesses are becoming more open to<b> external </b>influences. In particular, companies are<b> consulting </b>customers more and more before making their business decisions (Q34). Companies are finding out what they want and providing it, instead of making products and then <b>trying to sell</b> them, which is the model of <b>years ago</b>.","Another influence is that <b>concerns about the environment</b> will force manufacturers to extend product lifecycles, to reduce the <b>amount of pollution</b> and waste. And in <b>some cases</b>, regulation will need to be strengthened. (Q35)","Many<b> societies </b>are much more fluid and democratic, and the structure of companies is changing to reflect that. I think we’re <b>going to see</b> a greater<b> emphasis </b>within companies on teams created with a specific project in mind (Q36). And when they’re completed, the teams will be<b> disbanded </b>and <b>new ones</b> formed.","More and more <b>people see</b> work as simply <b>one part</b> of their lifestyle, and not the <b>most important</b> one, and as the workforce is<b> shrinking </b>in some countries, businesses are having to compete for staff instead of being about to choose among a lot of applicants. Typical examples that will attract and retain staff are traditional ones like flexible hours (Q37) and – <b>something that has</b> been <b>made possible</b> by advances in technology – remote working, with people based at their home, abroad, or <b><b>almost any</b>where</b> they choose.","——————-","Management styles will <b>almost certainly</b> continue to change. <b>Senior managers</b> will require a lot more than the efficiency that they’ve always needed. Above all they’ll need great skills in leadership (Q38), so that their organisation can initiate and respond to change in a fast-moving world, where they face lots of competing requirements and potential conflicts.","In most of the world, the <b>senior managers</b> of large businesses are mainly men in their fifties and sixties. The predominant style of management will <b>almost certainly</b> become more<b> consultative </b>and collaborative, caused above all, by more women moving into senior management positions. (Q39)","Many of the changes are influenced by developments in the wider economy. The traditional<b> emphasis </b>of business was manufacturing, and of course the service sector is <b>very important</b>. But we shouldn’t overlook the growing financial contribution of IP, that is, intellectual property. Some books and films generate enormous sums from the sale of related DVDs, music, games, clothes, and so on.","Another point I’d <b>like to make</b> is that although I’ve been talking about companies, <b>one trend</b> that they have to face is the <b>move away</b> from <b>people working</b> for the <b>same employer</b> for years. Instead, more and more people are becoming self-employed (Q40), to gain the freedom and control over their lives that they’re <b>unlikely to get</b> from being employed.","OK, well that’s all I want to say, so let’s open it up for discussion."]},{"name":"GLS/10-3","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Early Learning Childcare Centre Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of <b>Early <b><b>Learning Childcare</b> Centre</b></b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 3 is as follows:","DIRECTOR:          <b>Good morning</b>.

Tell us about the Trust, Alice.","ALICE:                  Well, obviously its purpose is to protect dolphins in seas all a<b>round the world</b>. It tries to raise people’s awareness of the problems these marine creatures are suffering because of<b> pollution </b>and other threats. It started <b>ten years</b> ago and it’s one of the fastest growing animal charities in the country – although it’s <b>still fairly</b> small compared with the big players in animal protection.","We are particularly proud of the work we do in education – <b>last year</b> we visited a huge <b>number of schools</b> in <b>different parts</b> of the country, going round to talk to <b><b>children and young</b> people</b> aged from five to eighteen.","In fact, about thirty-five <b>per cent</b> of our members are children. The charity uses its <b>money to support</b> campaigns – for example, for changes in fishing policy and so forth (Q11&Q12). It hopes soon to be able to employ its first full-time biologist – with dolphin expertise – to monitor populations. Of course, <b>many people</b> give their services on a voluntary basis and we <b>now have</b> volunteers working in observation, <b>office work</b> and <b>other things</b>. (Q11&Q12)","<b>I </b> should <b>also tell</b> you about the award we won from the Charity<b> Commission </b><b>last year</b> – for our work in education. Although it’s not meant an enormous <b>amount of money</b> for us, it <b>has made</b> our activities even more <b>widely publicised</b> and understood (Q13). In the <b>long term</b> it may not bring in extra members but we’re<b> hoping </b>it’ll have this effect.","INTERVIEWER:   Is it possible to <b>see dolphins</b> in UK waters?","ALICE:                  Yes. In <b>several locations</b>. And we have a <b>big project</b> in the east part of Scotland. This <b>has long</b> been a haven for dolphins because it has <b>very little</b> shipping. However, that may be about to change soon because <b>oil companies</b> <b>want to increase</b><b> exploration </b>there. We’re campaigning against this because, although there’ll be little<b> pollution </b>from oil,<b> exploration </b>creates a lot of underwater noise (Q14). It means the dolphins can’t rest and socialise.","This is how I <b>became interested</b> in <b>dolphin conservation</b> in the <b>first place</b>. I <b>had never</b> seen one and I hadn’t been <b>particularly interested</b> in them at school. Then I <b>came across</b> this story about a family of dolphins who had to leave their home in the Moray Firth because of the <b>oil companies</b> and about a child who campaigned to save them. I couldn’t put the book down – I was hooked. (Q15)","—————————","INTERVIEWER:   I’m sure our listeners will <b>want to find</b> out what they can <b>do to help</b>. You mentioned the ‘Adopt a Dolphin’ scheme. Can you tell us about that?","ALICE:                  Of course! People can choose one of our dolphins to sponsor. They receive a picture of it and news updates. I’d <b>like to tell</b> you about four which are currently being adopted by our members: Moondancer, Echo, Kiwi and Samson.","Unfortunately, Echo is being rather<b> elusive </b>this year and hasn’t yet been sighted by our observers (Q16) but we remain<b> optimistic </b>that he’ll be out there soon. <b><b>All the other</b>s</b> have been out in force – Samson and Moondancer are often photographed together but it is Kiwi who’s our real ‘character’ as she seems to love <b>coming up</b> close for the cameras and we’ve captured her on film hundreds of times (Q17).","They all <b>have their own</b><b> personalities </b>– Moondancer is very elegant and curves out and into the water very smoothly, whereas Samson <b>has a lot</b> of energy – he’s always leaping out of the water with great<b> vigour </b>(Q18). You’d probably expect him to be the youngest – he’s not quite – that’s Kiwi – but Samson’s the latest of our dolphins to be chosen for the scheme (Q19).","Kiwi makes a lot of noise so we can often pick her out straightaway. Echo and Moondancer are noisy too, but Moondancer’s <b>easy to find</b> <b>because she has</b> a particularly large fin on her back, which makes her easy to identify (Q20). So, yes, they’re all <b>very different</b> …","INTERVIEWER:   Well, they sound a fascinating group …","#3 <b><b>Theatre Studies</b> Course</b> Transcript","The Part 3 <b>audio <b>transcript of Theatre</b></b> <b>Studies Course</b> in Cambridge 10 <b>Listening Test</b> 3 is as follows:","MIA:      Hi, Rob.

It was good.","ROB:      Really? Yeah … but now we have to <b>write a report</b> on the <b>whole thing</b>, an in-depth analysis. I don’t know where to start. Like, I <b>have to write</b> about the role I played, the doctor, how I developed the character.","MIA:      Well, what was your <b>starting point</b>?","ROB:      Er … my grandfather was a doctor before he retired, and I just based it on him.","MIA:      OK, but how? Did you <b>talk to him</b> about it?","ROB:      He must have <b>all sorts</b> of stories, but he never says much about his work, even now. He has a sort of authority though.","MIA:      So how did you manage to capture that?","ROB:      I’d … I’d visualise what he must <b>have been like</b> in the past, when he was sitting in his<b> consulting </b>room listening to his patients. (Q21)","MIA:      OK, so that’s what you explain in your report.","ROB:      Right.","MIA:      Then there’s the issue of atmosphere – so in the <b>first scene</b> we <b>needed to know</b> how boring life was in the doctor’s village in the 1950s, so when the curtain <b>went up</b> on the <b>first scene</b> in the waiting room, there was that long silence before anyone spoke. And then people kept <b><b>saying the same</b> thing</b> over and over, like ‘Cold, isn’t it?’ (Q22)","ROB:      Yes, and everyone wore grey and brown, and just sat in a row.","MIA:      Yes, all those details of the production.","ROB:      And I <b>have to analyse</b> how I functioned in the group – what I found out about myself. I know I was so frustrated at times, when we couldn’t agree.","MIA:      Yes. So did <b>one person</b><b> emerge </b>as the leader?","ROB:      <b>Sophia did</b>. That was OK – she helped us work out exactly what to do, for the production. And that <b>made me</b> feel better, I suppose. (Q23)","MIA:      When you understood what needed doing?","ROB:      Yes. And <b>Sophia did</b> <b>some research</b>, too. That was useful in developing our approach.","MIA:      Like what?","ROB:      Well, she found these articles from the 1950s about how <b>relationships between children</b> and their parents, or between the public and <b>people like</b> bank managers or the police were shifting. (Q24)","MIA:      Interesting. And <b><b>did you have</b> any</b> practical problems to overcome?","ROB:      Well, in the final<b> rehearsal </b>everything was going fine <b>until the last</b><b> scene </b>– what’s where the doctor’s first patient appears on stage on his own.","MIA:      The one in the wheelchair?","ROB:      Yes, and he had this really long speech, with the stage all dark <b>except for one</b><b> spotlight </b>– and then that<b> stuck </b>somehow so it was shining on the wrong side of the stage (Q25) … but anyway we got that fixed, thank goodness.","MIA:      Yes, it was fine on the night.","———————–","ROB:      But while you’re here, Mia. I <b>wanted to ask</b> you about the year abroad option. Would you recommend doing that?","MIA:      Yes, definitely. It’s a fantastic chance to study in another country for a year.","ROB:      I think I’d <b>like to do</b> it, but it looks <b>very competitive</b> – there’s only a limited number of places.","MIA:      Yes, so <b>next year</b> when you are in the <b>second year</b> of the course, you need to work really hard in all your <b>theatre studies</b> modules. Only students with good marks get places – you have to prove that you know your subject <b>really well</b>. (Q26)","ROB:      Right. So how <b>did you choose</b> where to go?","MIA:      Well, I decided I wanted a programme that would fit in with what I <b>wanted to do</b> after I graduate, so I looked for a university with<b> emphasis </b>on acting rather than directing for example. It depends on you (Q27). Then about <b>six months</b> before you go, you have to email the scheme coordinator with your top three choices. I had a friend who missed the deadline and didn’t get her <b>first choice</b>, so you do <b>need to get</b> a move on at that stage (Q28). You’ll find that <b>certain places</b> are <b>very popular</b> with everyone.","ROB:      And don’t you <b>have to write</b> a personal statement at that stage?","MIA:      Yes.","ROB:      Right. I’ll <b>get some</b> of the <b>final year</b> students to <b><b>give me</b> some</b> tips (Q29) … maybe see if I can read what they wrote.","MIA:      I think that’s a very <b>good idea</b>. I don’t mind showing you what I did. And while you’re abroad don’t make the mistake I made. I got so involved I for<b>got all</b> about making arrangements for when I came <b>back here</b> for the <b>final year</b>. <b>Make sure</b> you <b>stay in touch</b> so they know your choices for the optional modules (Q30).

Self-<b><b>regulatory focus</b> theory</b> is a theory developed by Tori Higgins. He says that a person’ focus at <b>any <b>given time</b></b> is to either approach pleasure or avoid pain. These are two basic motivations that each and <b>every one</b> of us has, and they cause us to have <b>different kinds</b> of goals. <b>Promotion goals</b> in different life situations<b> emphasise </b>achievement (Q31). <b>Prevention goals</b> are<b> oriented </b>towards the avoidance of punishment.","In a specific situation, our thoughts might <b><b>focus more on promotion</b> goals</b> or more on <b>prevention goals</b>. The <b>theory suggests</b> that <b>two factors</b> affect which <b>goals we are focusing</b> on. First, there is a chronic factor. This factor is connected to a person’s personality (Q32) and says that <b>each person</b> has a basic<b> tendency </b>to either <b><b>focus more on promotion</b> goals</b> or focus more on <b>prevention goals</b> as part of his or her personality.","Second, there is a situational factor which means that the context we are in can make us more likely to focus on one set of goals or the other (Q33). For example, we are more likely to be thinking about pleasure and to have <b>promotion goals</b> when we are <b>spending time</b> with a friend (Q34). In contrast, if we are working on an important project for our boss, we are more likely to <b>try to avoid</b> making mistakes and <b>therefore have</b> more <b>prevention goals</b> in our mind.","<b><b>Research has</b> shown</b> that the <b>goals we are focusing</b> on at a <b>given time</b> <b>affect the way</b> we think. For example, when focusing on <b>promotion goals</b>, people consider their ideal self, their aspirations and gains (Q35). They don’t think about what they can lose, so they think in a happier mode. They feel more inspired to change.","When people are focusing on <b>prevention goals</b>, they think about their “ought” self. What are they supposed to be? What are people expecting from them? They consider their obligations to others. As a result, they experience more anxiety and <b>try to avoid</b> situations where they could lose.","———————–","Now that I have talked about the two focuses and how they affect people, I <b>want to look</b> at the idea that the way leaders behave, or their style of leading, can affect the focus that followers adopt in a specific situation (Q36). In talking about leadership, we often mention <b>transformational leaders</b> and <b>transactional leaders</b>. <b>Transformational leaders</b>, when interacting with their followers, focus on their development (Q37).","In their words and actions <b>transformational leaders</b> highlight change. Their speech is passionate and conveys a<b> definitive </b>vision (Q38). All of these things can encourage followers to think about what could be. In other words, they inspire a <b>promotion focus</b> in their followers.","In contrast, <b>transactional leaders</b> focus on developing clear structures that tell their followers exactly what is expected of them (Q39). While they do explain the rewards people will get for following orders, they<b> emphasise </b>more how a follower will be punished or that a follower won’t get rewarded if his or her behaviour doesn’t change. In short, they<b> emphasise </b>the consequences of <b>making a mistake</b>. This<b> emphasis </b>will clearly lead followers to focus on avoiding punishment and problems. This is clearly a <b>prevention focus</b>.","In conclusion, it is important to understand that one focus is not necessarily better than the <b>other one</b>. For a designer who works in a field where a lot of innovation (Q40) is needed, a <b>promotion focus</b> is <b>probably better</b>. In contrast, a <b>prevention focus</b> which causes people to work more cautiously and produce <b>higher quality</b> work might be very appropriate for a job like a surgeon, for example. The <b>main point</b> of the research, though, is that the <b>actions of leaders</b> can greatly influence whether <b>people approach</b> a situation with more of a <b>promotion focus</b> or more of a <b>prevention focus</b>."]},{"name":"GLS/10-4","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Thorndyke’s builders Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of Thorndyke’s builders in <b>Listening Test</b> 4 is as follows:","MR THORNDYKE:    Thorndyke’s","EDITH:                  <b>Good morning</b>.

All the family can enjoy a day out at Manham: visit our copper mine, see models of the<b> machinery </b>it used, have your photo taken in nineteenth-century costume, experience at first hand how <b>people lived</b> at <b>different stages</b> throughout history, and especially how children studied, worked and played.","The <b>port of Manham</b> is located in beautiful and peaceful countryside, on a bend in the great River Avon, and developed here because it’s the highest navigable point of the Avon – boats can go no <b>higher up</b> this river – and proved a handy place to load and unload cargo to and from the sea (Q11), which is over 23 miles away.","<b>A </b> small port was <b>already established</b> here when, about 900 <b>years ago</b>,<b> tin </b>was discovered nearby, though it wasn’t until the <b>Industrial Revolution</b>, when a tremendous need for metals of <b>all kinds</b> developed, that Manham expanded to become one of the busiest ports in the country (Q12).","And because it was already so busy, prospectors began to look for other minerals, and by the <b>end of the nineteenth</b> century, lead, copper,<b> manganese </b>and<b> arsenic </b>were added to the cargos leaving Manham.","In the early days, the<b> ores </b>had been<b> smelted </b>– or processed – in the same area they were mined. But, as demand grew, the<b> smelting </b>process required huge factory<b> furnaces </b>or fires to melt the metal from the rock and there was not enough coal in the local area, so the rocks containing minerals had to be shipped <b>long distances</b>. (Q3)","Sadly, in the <b>twentieth century</b>, the great <b>port of Manham</b> declined, and thousands of workers were forced to emigrate out of the area (Q14). The building at the port fell into disrepair, and the place became almost forgotten. But then, the Manham Trust was formed to<b> conserve </b>the historical resources of the area. It organised scores of local volunteers to remove undergrowth to find the original outlines of the installations.","It then brought in paid professionals to match installations with maps of the original port complex and to set about<b> reconstructing </b>it (Q15). Today you can see the results of this ambitious programme of restoration. The intention, and we believe this will be realised before the <b>end of the year</b>, is to return <b>Manham Port</b> to the condition it reached at its peak as ‘the greatest copper port in the country’.","——————","But what can you do and see on your visit today? <b><b>Here are just</b> a few</b> highlights. We suggest you start with the visit to the copper mine. Travel on converted mining trains and journey into the depths of the mountain along<b> seams </b>once worked by hundreds of miners (Q16). Watch out especially for the great<b> pumping </b>machines which<b> rid </b>the mine of water. But please be warned that, <b>like all</b> mines, ours is very dark and closed in and we do say that children under five and <b>also do</b>gs should NOT be taken into the mine. (Q17)","The next recommended visit is to the village school. While looking round the classrooms, take a special look at our display of games, which is <b>one of the <b>largest in the world</b></b> (Q18). And it’s recommended that you time your visit to<b> coincide </b>with a <b>guided tour</b> (Q19). This will <b>give you the opportunity</b> to ask lots of questions.","<b>Near the school</b> is the beautiful <b>old sailing</b><b> ketch </b><b>called ‘The</b> George’. You are welcome to board the boat and look round the cabins. Look out for the shop’s wheel which was missing until only <b>five years</b> ago when it was<b> dredged </b>out of the<b> silt </b>by a local fisherman. We <b><b>have no</b> idea</b> how it got there but it’s been<b> polished </b>and proudly restored to its original place on the boat. Please <b>take care</b> <b>going down</b> the ladders if you wish to visit the lower deck – we don’t recommend you allow <b>young children</b> to use them. (Q20)","So we hope you have a memorable visit to <b>Manham Port</b> and will tell your friends all about us.","#3 Laura’s <b>work placement</b> Transcript","The Part 3 <b>audio transcript</b> of Laura’s <b>work placement</b> in Cambridge 10 <b>Listening Test</b> 4 is as follows:","TIM:                      Hi, Laura – could you <b>spare a <b>few minutes</b></b> to talk about the <b>work placement</b> you <b>did last</b> summer? I’m <b>thinking of doing</b> one myself …","LAURA:                Hi, Tim. Sure.","TIM:                      Didn’t you do yours at an environmental services company?","LAURA:                That’s right … It’s only a very <b>small company</b> and they needed someone to produce a company brochure, and I <b>wanted to get</b> some business experience because I’m <b>interested in a career</b> in<b> occupational </b>psychology in a business environment. It was good <b>because I had</b> overall<b> responsibility </b>for the project.","TIM:                      What kind of skills <b>do you think</b> you developed on the placement? I mean, apart from the ones you <b>already had</b> … <b>Did you have</b> to <b>do all</b> the artwork for the brochure, the layout and everything?","LAURA:                We hired the services of a professional photographer for that. I did <b>have to use</b> my IT skills to a certain extent because I cut and pasted text from marketing leaflets, but that didn’t involve anything I hadn’t done before.","TIM:                      <b>Do you think</b> you <b>got any</b> better at managing your time and<b> prioritizing </b>things? You always used to say you had trouble with that … (Q21&Q22)","LAURA:                Oh, definitely. There was so much pressure to meet the project deadline. And I <b>also got</b> better at <b>explaining things</b> and asserting my opinions (Q21&Q22), <b>because I had</b> to have weekly consultations with the marketing manager and <b>give him</b> a progress report.","TIM:                      It sounds as if you <b>got a lot</b> out of it then.","LAURA:                Absolutely. It was really worthwhile … But you know, the company benefited too …","TIM:                      Yes, they must <b>have done</b>. After all, if they’d used a professional advertising agency to produce their brochure instead of doing it in-house,<b> presumably </b>they’d have paid a lot more?","LAURA:                Oh, yes. I worked it out – it would have been 250 <b>per cent</b> more (Q23&Q24). And I thought the end result was good, <b>even though</b> we did everything on site. The <b>company has</b> quite a powerful computer and I managed to borrow some<b> scanning </b>software from the university. The new brochure looks really professional; it enhances the image of the company <b>straight away</b> (Q23&Q24).","TIM:                      So in the <b>long run</b> it should help them to attract clients, and improve their <b>sales figures</b>?","LAURA:                That’s the idea. Yeah.","———————–","TIM:                      Well, all in all it sounds <b>very positive</b> – I think I will <b>go ahead</b> and apply for a placement myself. How do I go about it?","LAURA:                It’s <b>easy enough</b> to do, because there’s a government agency called STEP – S-T-E-P – that organises placements for students. You should start by getting their booklet with all the details – I expect you can download one from their website.","TIM:                      Actually, they’ve got copies in the<b> psychology </b>department – I’ve seen them there. I’ll <b>just go</b> to the office and pick one up. (Q25)","LAURA:                Right. And then if I were you, after I’d looked at it I’d go over all the options with someone …","TIM:                      I suppose I should ask my tutor’s advice. He knows more about me than anyone.","LAURA:                One of the career officers would be better (Q26), they’ve got more knowledge about the jobs market than your personal tutor would have.","TIM:                      OK …","LAURA:                And then when you <b>know what you want</b> you can register with STEP – you’ll find their address in the booklet. And once you’ve registered they assign you to a mentor who looks after your application.","TIM:                      And then I suppose you <b><b>just sit</b> back</b> and wait till you <b>hear something</b>?","LAURA:                They <b>told me</b> at the <b>careers office</b> that it’s best to be proactive, and <b>get up</b>dates yourself by checking the website for new placement alerts (Q27). Your mentor is supposed to keep you informed, but you can’t rely on that.","TIM:                      I don’t suppose it’s a <b>good idea</b> to <b>get in touch</b> with companies directly, is it?","LAURA:                Not really … But it is the company who notifies you if they want you to go for an interview. You get a letter of invitation or an email from<b> personnel </b>departments. (Q28)","TIM:                      And do I reply directly to them?","LAURA:                Yes, you do. STEP only <b>gets involved</b> again once you’ve been made a <b>job offer</b>.","TIM:                      Right … So, once you’ve had an interview you should let your mentor know what the outcome is? I mean whether you’re offered a job, and whether you’ve decided to accept it? (Q29)","LAURA:                That’s right. They’ll inform the <b>careers office</b> once a placement has been agreed, so you don’t <b>have to do</b> that.","TIM:                      Is that all then?","LAURA:                More or less. <b>Only once</b> you’ve accepted an offer you’ll <b>probably have</b> to supply a reference, because the placement will be conditional on that. And that’s something you should ask your own tutor to provide (Q3). He knows about your academic ability and also about your qualities, like reliability.","TIM:                      Well, <b><b>thanks very</b> much</b> for the information – I’m starting to <b>look forward</b> …","#4 <b>Nanotechnology Transcript</b>","The Part 4 <b>audio transcript</b> of Nanotechnology-Technology on a small scale in Cambridge 10 <b>Listening Test</b> 4 is as follows:","Today we’re <b>going to <b>look at an important</b></b> area of science, namely nanotechnology. So what is it? Nano means tiny, so it’s science and engineering on the scale of atoms and molecules. The idea is that by controlling and<b> rearranging </b>atoms, you can literally <b>create anything</b>. However, as we’ll see, the science of the small <b>has some</b> big implications affecting us in <b>many ways</b>.","There’s <b>no doubt</b> that<b> nanotechnology </b>promises so much for civilisation. However, all <b>new technologies</b> have their teething problems. And with nanotechnology, society <b>often gets</b> the wrong idea about its capabilities (Q31).","Numerous science-fiction books and movies have raised people’s fears about<b> nanotechnology </b>– with<b> scenarios </b>such as inserting little nano-robots into your body that monitor everything you do without you realising it, or self-replicating nano-robots that eventually take over the world.","So how do we<b> safeguard </b>such a potentially powerful technology? <b>Some scientists</b> recommend that nano-particles be treated as <b>new chemicals</b> with separate safety tests and clear labelling (Q32). They believe that greater care should also be taken with nano-particles in<b> laboratories </b>and factories. Others <b>have called</b> for a<b> withdrawal </b>of new nano <b>products such</b> as<b> cosmetics </b>and a<b> temporary </b>halt to <b>many kinds</b> of<b> nanotech </b>research.","But as far as I’m concerned there’s a need to<b> plough </b>ahead with the discoveries and applications of<b> nanotechnology </b>(Q33). I really believe that <b>most scientists</b> would welcome a way to guard against unethical uses of such technology.","We can’t go around thinking that all innovation is bad, all advancement is bad. As with the debate about any <b>new technology</b>, it is how you use it that’s important. So let’s <b>look at some</b> of its possible uses.","————————–","Thanks to nanotechnology, there could be a major breakthrough in the field of transportation with the production of more durable metals (Q34). These could be virtually unbreakable, lighter and much more<b> pliable </b>leading to planes that are 50 times lighter than at present.","Those same improved capabilities will <b>dramatically reduce</b> the cost of travelling into space making it more accessible to <b>ordinary people</b> (Q35) and opening up to totally new holiday destination.","In terms of technology, the computer industry will be able to<b> shrink </b>computer parts down to minute sizes. We need<b> nanotechnology </b>in order to create a <b>new generation</b> of computers that will work even faster and will have a million times more memory but will be about the size of a sugar cube (Q36).<b> Nanotechnology </b>could also <b>revolutionise the way</b> that we generate power.","The cost of solar cells will be<b> drastically </b>reduced so harnessing this energy will be far more economical than at present. (Q37)","But<b> nanotechnology </b>has <b>much wider</b> applications than this and could have an <b>enormous impact</b> on our environment. For instance, tiny airborne nano-robots could be programmed to actually rebuild the<b> ozone </b>layer, which could lessen the impact of <b>global warming</b> on our planet.","That’s a pretty amazing thought, isn’t it? On a more local scale, this <b>new technology</b> could help with the clean-up of environmental disasters as<b> nanotechnology </b>will allow us to remove oil and other<b> contaminants </b>from the water far more effectively (Q38).","And, if<b> nanotechnology </b>progresses as expected – as a sort of <b>building block</b> set of about 90 atoms – then you could build anything you wanted from the bottom up. In terms of production, this means that you <b>only use</b> what you need and so there wouldn’t be any waste. (Q39)","The notion that you could <b>create anything</b> at all has major implications for our health. It means that we’ll eventually be able to<b> replicate </b>anything. This would have a<b> phenomenal </b>effect on our society. In time it could even <b>lead to the eradication</b> of famine through the introduction of machines that produce <b>food to feed</b> the hungry.","But it’s in the area of medicine that<b> nanotechnology </b>may have its biggest impact. How we detect disease will change as tiny<b> biosensors </b>are developed to analyse tests in minutes rather than days (Q40). There’s even<b> speculation </b>nano-robots could be <b>used to slow</b> the ageing process,<b> lengthening </b><b>life expectancy</b>.","As you can see, I’m very excited by the implications that could be available to us in the next <b>few decades</b>. Just how long it’ll take, I honestly don’t know."]},{"name":"GLS/11-1","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Hiring a public room Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of <b><b>Hiring a public</b> room</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 1 is as follows:","OFFICIAL:            Hello?","WOMAN:             Oh, hello.

But we do insist that this is paid in cash (Q3), we don’t take cards for that. You can pay the actual rent of the room however you like though – cash, <b>credit card</b>, cheque …","WOMAN:             Oh, <b>well I suppose</b> that’s OK.

This open-air museum gives you the experience of agriculture and rural life in the English countryside at the <b>end of the nineteenth</b> century. So you’ll see a typical farm of that period, and <b>like me</b>, <b>all the staff</b> are dressed in clothes of that time.","<b>I </b> must <b>give you some</b> advice and safety tips before we go <b>any further</b>. As it’s a working farm, <b>please do</b>n’t<b> frighten </b>or injure the animals (Q11). We <b>have a lot</b> here, and many of them are breeds that are now <b>quite rare</b>.","And do stay at a safe distance from the tools: <b>some of them have</b> sharp points which can be pretty dangerous, so <b>please do</b>n’t touch them (Q12). We don’t <b>want any</b> accidents, do we?","The <b>ground is very</b> uneven, and you might<b> slip </b>if you’re wearing<b> sandals </b>so I’m <b>glad to see</b> you’re all wearing shoes – we always advise people to do that. (Q13)","Now, <b><b>children of all</b> ages</b> are <b>very welcome</b> here, and usually even very <b>young children</b> love the ducks and lambs, so do bring them along <b>next time</b> you come.","<b>I </b> don’t think any of you <b>have brought</b> dogs with you, but in case you have, I’m afraid they’ll have to stay in the <b>car park</b> unless they’re guide dogs (Q14). I’m sure you’ll understand that they could cause a <b>lot of problems</b> on a farm.","Now <b>let <b>me <b>give you some</b></b></b> idea of the layout of the farm. The building where you bought your tickets is the New Barn, immediately to your right, and we’re now at the beginning of the <b>main path</b> to the farmland – and of course the <b>car park</b> is on your left. The<b> scarecrow </b>you can see in the <b>car park</b> in the corner, beside the <b>main path</b> (Q15), is a traditional figure for keeping the <b>birds away</b> from crops, but our<b> scarecrow </b>is a permanent sculpture. It’s taller than a human being, so you can see it from <b>quite a distance</b>.","If you look ahead of you, you’ll see a maze. It’s<b> opposite </b>the New Barn, beside the <b>side path</b> that branches off to the <b>right just</b> over there (Q16). The<b> maze </b>is made out of<b> hedges </b>which are too tall for <b>young children</b> to see over them, but it’s <b>quite small</b>, so you can’t <b>get lost</b> in it!","Now, can you see the bridge crossing the fish pool further up the <b>main path</b>? If you <b>want to go</b> to the café, go towards the bridge and turn <b>right just</b> before it. Walk along the <b>side path</b> and the café’s on the first bend you come to (Q17). The building was originally the schoolhouse, and it’s well over a <b>hundred years</b> old.","As you may know, we run skills workshops here, where you can learn traditional<b> crafts </b>like woodwork and basket-making. You can see examples of the work, and talk to someone about the courses, in the <b>Black Barn</b>. If you take the <b>side path</b> to the right, here, just by the New Barn, you’ll come to the <b>Black Barn</b> just where the path first bends. (Q18)","Now I mustn’t <b>forget to tell</b> you about picnicking, as I can see <b>some of you have</b> brought your lunch with you. You can picnic in the field, though do <b>clear up</b> behind you, of course. Or if you’d prefer a <b>covered picnic</b> area, there’s one near the farmyard: just after you cross the bridge, there’s a <b>covered picnic</b> spot on the right.

Yeah. I was interested that the researchers were actually a mix of<b> psychologists </b>and physicists. That’s an<b> unusual </b>combination.","LISA:      Yeah. I got a little confused at first about which students the study was based on. They weren’t actually majoring in<b> physics </b>– they were majoring in what’s known as the<b> STEM </b>disciplines. That’s science, technology, engineering and … (Q21)","GREG:    … and math. Yes, but they were all doing <b>physics courses</b> as part of their studies.","LISA:      That’s correct. So as I understood it, Miyake and co started from the fact that women are<b> underrepresented </b>in<b> introductory </b><b>physics courses</b> at college, and also that on average, the women who do enrol on these courses perform more poorly than the men. <b>No <b>one <b><b>really know</b>s</b></b></b> why this is the case.","GREG:    Yeah. But what the researchers <b>wanted to find</b> out was basically what they could do about the relatively low level of the women’s results (Q22). But in order to <b>find a solution</b> they needed to find out more about the nature of the problem.","LISA:      Right – <b>now let</b>’s see if I can remember … it was that in the<b> physics </b>class, the <b>female students</b> thought the male students all assumed that women weren’t any good at<b> physics </b>… was that it? And they thought that the men expected them to <b>get <b>poor results</b></b> in their tests.","GREG:    That’s what the women thought, and that made them nervous, so they did <b>get <b>poor results</b></b>. But actually they were wrong … <b>No one</b> was <b>making any</b> assumption about the <b>female students</b> at all. (Q23)","LISA:      Anyway, what Miyake’s team did was quite simple – getting the students to <b>do some</b> writing before they went into the<b> physics </b>class. What did they call it?","GREG:    Values-affirmation – they had to write an essay focusing on things that were significant to them, not particularly to do with the subject they were studying, but more general <b>things like</b> music or people who mattered to them. (Q24)","LISA:      Right. So the idea of <b>doing the writing</b> is that this gets the students thinking in a positive way.","GREG:    And putting these thoughts into words can relax them and help them overcome the<b> psychological </b>factors that lead to poor performance (Q25). Yeah. But what the researchers in the study hadn’t expected was that this one activity raised the women’s<b> physics </b>grades from the C to the B range. (Q26)","LISA:      A huge change. Pity it wasn’t to an A, but still! No, but it <b>does suggest</b> that the women were seriously underperforming beforehand, in comparison with the men.","GREG:    Yes. Mind you, Miyake’s article left out a lot of details. Like, <b>did the students</b> to the writing just once, or <b>several times</b>? And had they been told why they were <b>doing the writing</b>? That might <b>have affected</b> the results. (Q27)","LISA:      You mean, if they know the researchers thought it might help them to improve, then they’d just try to<b> fulfil </b>that expectation?","GREG:    Exactly.","——————-","GREG:    So anyway, I thought for our project we could do a similar study, but investigate whether it really was the writing activity that had that result.","LISA:      OK. So we could ask them to do a <b>writing task</b> about something <b>completely different</b> … something more factual? Like a <b>general knowledge</b> topic.","GREG:    Maybe … or we could have half the students doing a <b>writing task</b> and half <b><b>doing some</b>thing</b> else, like an oral task.","LISA:      Or even, half <b>do the same</b> <b>writing task</b> as in the original research and <b>half do</b> a<b> factual </b><b>writing task</b> (Q28). Then we’d see if it really is the topic that made the difference, or something else.","GREG:    That’s it. Good. So at our meeting with the<b> supervisor </b>on Monday we can tell him we’ve decided on our project. We should have our aims ready by then. I suppose we need to read the original study – the article’s just a summary.","LISA:      And these was <b>another article</b> I read, by Smolinsky. It was about her research on how <b>women and men</b> perform in mixed teams in class, compared with single-sex teams and on their own.","GREG:    <b>Let <b>me guess</b></b> … the women were better at teamwork.","LISA:      That’s what I expected, but actually the men and the women got the same results whether they were working in teams or on their own (Q29). But I guess it’s not that<b> relevant </b>to us.","GREG:    What worries me anyway is how we’re going to <b>get everything</b> done in the time.","LISA:      We’ll be OK now we know what we’re doing. Though I’m not clear how we assess whether the students in our experiment <b>actually make</b> any progress or not …","GREG:    No. We may need <b>some advice</b> on that. The <b>main thing</b>’s to <b>make sure</b> we <b>have the right</b> size sample, not too big or <b>too small</b>.","LISA:      That shouldn’t be difficult. Right, what <b><b>do we need</b> to do</b> next? We could <b>have a look</b> at the timetable for the science classes … or perhaps we should just <b>make an appointment</b> to <b>see one</b> of the science professors. That’d be better. (Q30)","GREG:    Great. And we could <b>even get</b> to observe one of the classes.","LISA:      What for?","GREG:    Well … OK maybe let’s <b>just go</b> with your idea. Right, well …","#4 <b>Ocean Biodiversity</b> Transcript","The Part 4 <b>audio transcript</b> of <b>Ocean Biodiversity</b> in Cambridge 11 <b>Listening Test</b> 1 is as follows:","I’ve been looking at <b>ocean biodiversity</b>, that’s the <b>diversity of species</b> that live in the world’s oceans. About 20 <b>years ago</b> biologists <b>developed the idea</b> of what they called ‘biodiversity hotspots’. These are the areas which have the greatest mixture of species, so <b>one example</b> is Madagascar. These<b> hotspots </b>are significant because they allow us to locate <b>key areas</b> for focusing efforts at conservation (Q31). Biologists can identify<b> hotspots </b>on land, fairly easily, but <b>until recently</b>, <b>very little</b> was known about<b> species </b>distribution and diversity in the oceans, and <b>no one</b> even knew if<b> hotspots </b>existed there.","Then a Canadian <b>biologist called</b> Boris Worm did <b>some research</b> in 2005 on data on ocean<b> species </b>that he got from the <b>fishing industry</b>. Worm located five<b> hotspots </b>for large ocean predators like sharks, and looked at what they <b>had in common</b>. The <b>main thing</b> he’d expected to find was that they had <b>very high</b><b> concentrations </b>of food, but to his surprise that was only true for four of the<b> hotspots </b>– the remaining<b> hotspots </b>was quite badly off in that regard (Q32).","But what he <b>did find</b> was that in all cases, the water at the surface of the ocean had relatively high temperatures, even when it was cool at <b>greater depths</b> (Q33), so this seemed to be a factor in supporting a <b>diverse range</b> of these <b>large predators</b>. However, this wasn’t enough on its own, because he <b>also found</b> that the water needed to <b>have enough</b><b> oxygen </b>in it (Q34) – so these <b>two factors</b> seemed necessary to support the high<b> metabolic </b>rate of these large fish.","<b>A </b> <b>couple of years</b> later, in 2007, a researcher called Lisa Balance, who was working in California, also <b>started looking</b> for ocean hotspots, but not for fish – what she was interested in was marine mammals, <b>things like</b><b> seals </b>(Q35). And she found three places in the oceans which were hotspots, and what these <b>had in common</b> was that these<b> hotspots </b>were all located at boundaries between ocean currents, and this seems to be the sort of place that has lots of the<b> plankton </b>that <b>some of these species</b> feed on.","So now people who <b>want to protect</b> the<b> species </b>that are endangered <b>need to get</b> as <b>much information</b> as possible. For example, there’s an international <b>project called</b> the Census of Marine Life. They’ve been surveying oceans <b>all over the world</b>, including the Arctic. <b>One thing</b> they found there which<b> stunned </b><b>other researchers</b> was that there were <b>large <b>numbers of species</b></b> which live below the ice (Q36) – sometimes under a layer up to 20 metres thick.","<b>Some of these species</b> <b>had never</b> been seen before. They’ve <b>even found</b><b> species </b>of<b> octopus </b>living in these conditions. And <b>other scientists</b> working on the same project, but researching <b>very different</b><b> habitats </b>on the ocean floor, <b>have found</b> <b>large <b>numbers of species</b></b><b> congregating </b>around volcanoes, attracted to them by the warmth and nutrients there.","——————–","However, biologists still don’t know how serious the <b>threat to their survival</b> is for <b>each individual</b> species. So a body called the Global <b>Marine Species</b> Assessment is now creating a list of <b>endangered species</b> on land, so they consider <b>things like</b> the size of the population – how <b>many members</b> of <b>one species</b> there are in a particular place – and then they look at their distribution in<b> geographical </b>terms, although this is <b>quite difficult</b> when you’re looking at fish, because they’re so mobile, and then thirdly they calculate the rate at which the decline of the<b> species </b>is happening. (Q37)","So far only 1,500 <b>species have</b> been assessed, but they <b>want to increase</b> this figure to 20,000. For <b>each one</b> they assess, they use the data they collect on that<b> species </b>to produce a map showing its distribution (Q38). Ultimately they will be <b>able to use</b> these to figure out not only where most<b> species </b>are located but also where they are most threatened.","So finally, what can be done to retain the <b>diversity of species</b> in the world’s oceans? Firstly, we <b>need to set</b> up more<b> reserves </b>in our oceans, places where <b>marine species</b> are protected. We <b>have some</b>, but not enough. In addition, to<b> preserve </b><b>species such</b> as<b> leatherback </b>turtles, which live out in the high seas but have their nesting sites on the American coast, we need to create corridors for migration, so they can get from <b>one area</b> to another safely.","As well as this, action <b>needs to be taken</b> to lower the levels of fishing<b> quotas </b>to prevent<b> overfishing </b>of <b>endangered species</b>. And finally, there’s the problem of ‘by-catch’. This<b> prefers </b>to the catching of unwanted fish by <b>fishing boats</b> – they’re returned to the sea, but they’re often dead or dying. If these commercial <b>fishing boats</b> used equipment which was more selective, so that only the fish wanted for consumption were caught, this problem could be overcome.","OK. So does anyone <b>have any</b> …"]},{"name":"GLS/11-2","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Enquiry about joining Youth council Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of <b><b><b>Enquiry about joining</b> Youth</b> council</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 2 is as follows:","CAROLINE:          <b>Good Morning</b>. <b>Youth Council</b>.

Great to see you! I’m Jody, and I’ll be look after both of you for the first month you’re <b>working here</b> at the Amersham Theatre. I’ll <b>tell you something</b> about the theatre now, then take you to meet two of the other staff.","It’s an old building, and it’s been<b> modernised </b><b>several times</b>. In fact, as you can see, we’re carrying out a <b>major refurbishment</b> at the moment. The interior <b>has just</b> been repainted, and we’re about to start on the<b> exterior </b>of the building – that’ll be a big job. The work’s running over budget, so we’ve had to postpone installing an elevator. I hope you’re happy running <b>up and down</b> stairs! When the theatre was built, <b>people were generally</b><b> slimmer </b>and shorter than now, and the seats were <b>very close</b> together. We’ve replaced them with larger seats, with more legroom. This means fewer seats in total, but we’ve taken the opportunity to install seats that can easily be moved (Q11&Q12), to create different acting spaces. We’ve also turned a few<b> storerooms </b>over to <b>other purposes</b> like using them for meetings. (Q11&Q12)","We try hard to involve <b>members of the public</b> in the theatre. <b>One way</b> is by organising<b> backstage </b>tours so people can be shown round the building and learn how a theatre operates. These are <b><b>proving very</b> popular</b> (Q13&14). What we’re finding is that people <b>want to have</b> lunch or a <b>cup of coffee</b> while they’re here, so we’re looking into the possibility of opening a café in due course. We have a bookshop, which specialises in books about drama and that attracts plenty of customers (Q13&Q14).","Then there are two large rooms that will be decorated <b>next month</b>, and they’ll be available for hire, for conferences and private functions, such as parties. We’re also considering hiring out costumes to amateur drama clubs.","Now I <b>want to tell</b> you about our workshops. We recently started a programme of workshops that anyone can join. Eventually we intend to run courses in acting, but we’re waiting until we’ve got the <b>right people</b> in place as trainers. That’s proving more difficult than we’d expected! There’s a big demand to learn about the technical side of putting on a production, and our lighting workshop has <b>already started</b> with <b>great success</b> (Q15&Q16).","We’re <b>going to start</b> one on sound <b>next month</b>. A <b>number of people</b> have enquired about workshops on make-up, and that’s something we’re considering for the future. A surprise success is the workshop on making puppets – we <b>happen to have</b> someone <b>working here</b> who does it as a hobby, and she offered to run a workshop. It was so popular we’re now running them <b>every month</b>! (Q15&Q16)","Now, a word about the layout of the building. The auditorium, stage and <b>dressing rooms</b> for the actors are all below <b>ground level</b>. Here on the <b>ground floor</b> we have most of the rooms that the public doesn’t see. The majority are internal, so they have windows in the roof to light them.","Standing here in the foyer, you’re probably wondering why the <b>box office</b> isn’t here, where the public would <b>expect to find</b> it. Well, you might <b><b>have no</b>ticed</b> it on your way in – although it’s part of this building, it’s <b>next door</b> with a separate <b>entrance from the road</b>. (Q17)","For the theatre manager’s office, you go across the<b> foyer </b>and through the double doors, <b>turn right</b>, and it’s the room at the end of the corridor, with the door on the left. (Q18)","The <b>lighting box</b> is where the computerised stage lighting is operated and it’s at the back of the building. When you’re through the double doors turn left, <b>turn right</b> at the water cooler, and right again at the end. It’s the <b>second room</b> along that corridor (Q19). The <b>lighting box</b> has a window into the auditorium, which of course is below us.","The artistic director’s office is through the double doors, <b>turn right</b> and it’s the first <b>room you come</b> to on the right-hand side (Q20). And finally, for the moment, the room where I’ll take you next – the<b> relaxation </b>room.

But we weren’t <b>really looking</b> at that.","HELEN:                 I suppose not. OK, now there’s the list of equipment we <b>all had</b> to bring on the <b>field trip</b>. What did they tell us to bring a ruler for?","COLIN:                 It was something about measuring the<b> slope </b>of the shore, but of course we didn’t need it because we were measuring wind direction, and we’d brought the<b> compass </b>for that …","HELEN:                 But not the piece of string to <b>hold up</b> in the air! Didn’t Mr Blake make a<b> fuss </b>about us leaving that behind. (Q22)","COLIN:                 Yeah. He does go on.

(Q23)","HELEN:                 OK. I’ll look at that again.","COLIN:                 Then we have to describe our method of investigation in detail. So let’s begin with how we measured wave speed. I was surprised how<b> straightforward </b>that was. (Q24)","HELEN:                 I’d expected us to <b><b>have some</b> sort</b> of high-tech device, not just stand there and count the number of waves <b>per minute</b>. Not very precise, but I suppose it was <b>good enough</b>. But the way we measured the amount of salt was interesting.","COLIN:                 In the water from the <b>rock pools</b>?","HELEN:                 Yeah, oh, I wanted to check the chemicals we used in the lab when we analysed those samples – was it<b> potassium </b>chromate and silver nitrate?","COLIN:                 That’s right.","HELEN:                 OK. And we need the map of the seashore. You just left that to me. And I <b>had to do</b> in while the tide was low, well that was OK, but the place I started it from was down on the beach, then I realised I should <b>have gone</b> up higher to get better visibility (Q25), so I had to start <b>all over again</b>. But at least I’d go the squared paper or I’d have <b>had problems</b> drawing it all to scale.","COLIN:                 Yes. It looks good. We could get a map of the region off the internet and see if we <b>need to make</b> <b>any changes</b>.","HELEN:                 I <b>had a look</b> but I couldn’t <b>find anything</b>.

I’ll make my amendments using those, then I can scan it into our report (Q26). Great.","HELEN:                 Now when we get to our findings I thought we could divide them up into the different zones we identified on the shore and the problems organisms face in each zone. So for the highest area …","COLIN:                 … the<b> splash </b>zone?","HELEN:                 Yeah, we found mostly those tiny<b> shellfish </b>that have strong hard shells that act as protection.","COLIN:                 But not from other organisms that might eat them, predators?","HELEN:                 No, that’s not the main danger for them. But the shells prevent them from drying out because they’re in the <b>open air</b> for <b>most of the time</b>. (Q27&Q28)","COLIN:                 Right. And since they’ve exposed, they <b>need to be able</b> to <b>find some</b> sort of shelter, or cover themselves up, so they don’t <b>get too</b> hot (Q27&Q28). Then in the <b>middle and lower</b> zones, nearer the sea, we need to discuss the effects of wave action …","HELEN:                 Yes, and how organisms develop structures to prevent themselves from being<b> swept </b>away, or even destroyed by being<b> smashed </b>against the rocks.","COLIN:                 I haven’t done anything on the<b> geological </b>changes. I don’t know what to put for that.","HELEN:                 No, we weren’t<b> concentrating </b>on that. Maybe we <b><b>need to find</b> some</b> websites.","COLIN:                 <b>Good idea</b>.

But we could <b>ask him</b> which books on our <b>Reading List</b> might be most helpful.","HELEN:                 Right. OK, now I did a draft of the section of sources of possible error in our research, but I don’t know if you agree.

Now, how …","#4 <b><b><b>Designing Taylor</b> Concert</b> Hall</b> Transcript","The Part 4 <b>audio script</b> of <b><b><b>Designing Taylor</b> Concert</b> Hall</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 2 is as follows:","We’ve been discussing the factors the architect has to consider when designing domestic buildings. I’m going to <b>move on now</b> to consider the design of public buildings, and I’ll illustrate this by<b> referring </b>to the <b>new <b><b>Taylor Concert</b> Hall</b></b> that’s recently been completed <b>here in the city</b>.","So, as with a domestic building, when designing a public building, an <b>architect needs</b> to consider the function of the building – for example, is it to be used primarily for entertainment, or for education, or for administration? The second thing the <b>architect needs</b> to think about is the context of the building, this includes its physical location obviously, but it <b>also includes</b> the<b> social </b>meaning of the building how it relates to the people it’s built for (Q31).","And finally, for important public buildings, the architect may also be looking for a central<b> symbolic </b>idea on which to base the design, a sort of<b> metaphor </b>for the building and the way in which it is used.","Let’s look at the <b>new <b><b>Taylor Concert</b> Hall</b></b> in relation to these ideas. The location chosen was a site in a run-down district that has been ignored in previous<b> redevelopment </b>plans. It was occupied by a factory that had been empty for <b>some years</b> (Q32). The <b>whole area</b> was <b>some distance</b> from the high-rise office blocks of the central business district and shopping centre, but it was <b>only one</b> kilometre from the ring road. The side itself was bordered to the north by a canal (Q33) which had once been used by boats bringing in <b><b>raw material</b>s</b> when the area was used for manufacturing.","The architect chosen for the project was Tom Harrison. He found the main design challenge was the location of the site in an <b>area that had</b> no<b> neighbouring </b>buildings of <b>any importance</b>. To reflect the fact that the significance of the building in this quite run-down location was as yet unknown, he <b>decided to create</b> a building centred around the idea of a<b> mystery </b>– something whose meaning <b>still has</b> to be discovered.","So how was this reflected in the <b>design of the building</b>? Well, Harrison <b>decided to create</b><b> pedestrian </b>access to the building and to <b>make use</b> of the presence of water on the site. As <b>people approach</b> the entrance, they <b>therefore have</b> to cross over a bridge (Q34). He wanted to <b>give people</b> a feeling of<b> suspense </b>as they see the building first from a distance, and then close-up, and the initial impression he wanted to create from the shape of the building as a whole was that of a box (Q35).","The first side that <b>people see</b>, the southern wall, is just a high, <b>flat wall</b><b> uninterrupted </b>by any windows. This might sound off-putting, but it supports Harrison’s concept of the building – that the person approaching is<b> intrigued </b>and wonders what will be inside. And this <b>flat wall</b> <b>also has</b> another purpose. At night-time, projectors are switched on and it functions as a huge screen, onto which images are projected. (Q36)","The<b> auditorium </b>itself seats 1500 people. The floor’s supported by ten massive pads. These are constructed from rubber (Q37), and so are able to absorb any vibrations from outside and prevent them from affecting the auditorium. The walls are made of several layers of hony-coloured wood, all sourced from local beech trees. In order to improve the acoustic properties of the<b> auditorium </b>and to amplify the sound, they are not straight, they are curved (Q38).","The acoustics are also adjustable according to the size of<b> orchestra </b>and the type of music being played. In <b>order to achieve</b> this, there are nine movable panels in the ceiling above the<b> orchestra </b>which are all individually motorized, and the <b>walls also</b> have curtains which can be opened or closed to change the acoustics. (Q39)","The reaction of the public to the <b>new building</b> has generally been positive. However, the evaluation of some critics has been less enthusiastic. In<b> spite </b>of Harrison’s efforts to use local materials, they criticise the style of the design as being international rather than local (Q40), and say it doesn’t reflect features of the landscape or society for which it is built."]},{"name":"GLS/11-3","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Free activities in Burnham area Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of <b>Free <b><b>activities in Burnham</b> area</b></b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 3 is as follows:","MARTIN:              <b>Good morning</b>.

(Example)","MARTIN:              Yes, of course. OK. Then let’s start with a couple of events especially for children.

What time does it start?","MARTIN:              The gallery opens at 10, and the ‘Family Welcome’ event runs from 10.30 until 2 o’clock (Q1). The gallery stays open until 5. And <b>several times</b> <b>during the day</b>, they’re going to show a <b>short film</b> that the gallery <b>has produced</b>. It demonstrates how<b> ceramics </b>are made (Q2), and there’ll be equipment and materials for children to <b>have a go</b> themselves.","<b>Last time</b> they ran the event, there was a film about painting, which <b>went <b><b>down very</b> well</b></b> with the children, and they’re <b>now working</b> on one about sculpture.","SUE:                      I like the sound of that.

Our first speaker is Shona Ferguson, from Barford <b>town council</b>. Shone.","SHONA:  Thank you. First I’ll briefly <b>give you some</b> background information, then I’ll be asking you for your comments on developments in the town.","Well, as you don’t need <b>me to tell</b> you, Barford <b>has changed</b> a <b>great deal</b> in the last 50 years. These are <b>some of the main</b> changes.","<b>Fifty years</b> ago, buses linked <b>virtually every</b> part of the town and the<b> neighbouring </b>towns and villages. <b>Most people</b> used them frequently, but not <b>now because</b> the bus companies<b> concentrate </b>on just the routes that attract most passengers. So parts of the town are <b>no longer</b> served by buses (Q11).","Even replacing old uncomfortable buses with smart <b>new ones</b> has <b>had little</b> impact on passenger numbers. It’s sometimes said that bus fares are too high, but in relation to average incomes, fares are not <b>much higher</b> than they were 50 <b>years ago</b>.","Changes in the road network are affecting the town. The centre was recently <b>closed to traffic</b> on a trial basis, making it much safer to pedestrians. The impact of this is being measured. The new <b>cycle path</b>s separating bikes from cars in most <b>main road</b>s, are being used far more than was expected reducing traffic and improving <b>air quality</b> (Q12). And although the council’s attempts to have a bypass constructed have failed, we haven’t <b>given up</b> hope of persuading the government to <b>change its mind</b>.","Shopping in the <b>town centre</b> <b>has changed</b> over the years. Many of us can remember when the town was crowded with people going shopping. Numbers have been falling for several years, despite efforts to attract shoppers, for instance by opening new <b><b>car park</b>s</b>. <b>some people</b> combine shopping with visits to the town’s <b>restaurants and cafés</b>. Most shops are small independent stores, which is good, but many <b>people prefer</b> to use supermarkets and <b>department stores</b> in nearby large towns, as there are so few well-known chain stores here. (Q13)","Turning how to medical facilities, the town is served by family doctors in several medical practices – fewer than 50 <b>years ago</b>, but each<b> catering </b>for far more patients. Our hospital closed 15 <b>years ago</b> (Q14), which means journeys to other towns are unavoidable.","On the other hand, there are more dentists than there used to be. Employment patterns <b>have changed</b>, along with <b>almost every</b>thing else. The <b>number of schools</b> and colleges <b>has increased</b> making that the main employment sector (Q15). Services, such as website design and accountancy, <b>have grown</b> in importance, and surprisingly, perhaps, manufacturing hasn’t seen the decline that has affected it in <b>other parts</b> of the country.","—————-","Now I’ll <b>very quickly</b> outline current plans for some of the town’s facilities, before asking for your comments.","As you’ll know if you regularly use the <b>car park</b> at the railway station, it’s usually full. The <b>railway company</b> applied for permission to replace it with a multi-storey <b>car park</b>, but that was refused. Instead, the <b>company has</b> bought some adjoining land, and this will be used to <b>increase the number</b> of <b>parking spaces</b>. (Q16)","The Grand, the <b>old cinema</b> in the <b>high street</b> will close at the <b>end of the year</b>, and reopen on a different site (Q17). You’ve <b>probably seen</b> the building under construction. The plan is to <b>have three</b> screens with fewer seats, rather than just the one large<b> auditorium </b>in the <b>old cinema</b>.","<b>I </b> expect many of you<b> shop </b>in the indoor market. It’s become more and more shabby-looking, and because of fears about safety, it was<b> threatened </b>with demolition. The <b>good news</b> is that it will close for sex weeks to be made safe and redecorated, and the <b>improved building</b> will open in July. (Q18)","<b>Lots of people</b> use the library, including <b><b>school and college</b> students</b> who go there to study. The <b>council has</b> managed to secure funding to keep the library open later into the evening, <b>twice a week</b> (Q19). We would like to enlarge the building in the not-too-distant future, but this is by no means definite.","There’s no limit on access to the <b>nature reserve</b> on the edge of town, and this will continue be the case. What will change, though, is that the council will <b>no longer</b> be in charge of the area. Instead it will become the<b> responsibility </b>of a national body that administers most <b>nature reserve</b>s in the country. (Q20)","OK, <b><b>now let</b> me</b> ask you …","#3 <b>Subject of drawing</b> Transcript","The Part 3 <b>audio transcript</b> of <b>Subject of drawing</b> in Cambridge 11 <b>Listening Test</b> 3 is as follows:","JEREMY:              Hello, Helen.

I’ve looked at the drawings you’ve done for my story, ‘The Forest’, and I think they’re brilliant – they really create the atmosphere I had in mind when I was writing it.","HELEN:                 I’m glad you like them.","JEREMY:              T<b><b>here are just</b> a few</b> suggestions I’d <b>like to make</b>.","HELEN:                 <b>Go ahead</b>.","JEREMY:              Now, I’m not sure about the drawing of the cave – it’s got trees all around it (Q21), which is great, but the drawing’s a <b>bit too</b> static, isn’t it? I think it needs some action.","HELEN:                 Yes, there’s nothing happening. Perhaps I should add the boy – Malcolm, isn’t it? He would be walking up to it.","JEREMY:              Yes, let’s have Malcolm in the drawing. And what about putting in a tiger (Q22) – the one that he makes friends with a bit later? Maybe it could be sitting under a tree washing itself.","HELEN:                 And the tiger stops in the middle of what it’s doing when it sees Malcolm <b>walking past</b>.","JEREMY:              That’s a <b>good idea</b>.","HELEN:                 OK, I’ll <b>have a go</b> at that.","JEREMY:              Then there’s the drawing of the crowd of <b>men and women</b> dancing. They’re <b>just outside</b> the forest (Q23), and there’s a <b>lot going</b> on.","HELEN:                 That’s right, you wanted them to be watching a<b> carnival </b>procession, but I thought it would be too crowded. <b>Do you think</b> it works like this?","JEREMY:              Yes, I like what you’ve done. The <b>only thing</b> is, could you add Malcolm to it, without changing what’s already there.","HELEN:                 What about having him sitting on the tree trunk on the right of the picture?","JEREMY:              Yes, that would be fine.","HELEN:                 And <b>do you want</b> him watching the <b>other people</b>?","JEREMY:              No, he’s been left out of all the fun, so I’d <b>like him</b> to be crying (Q24) – that’ll contrast nicely with the next picture, where he’s laughing at the<b> clowns </b>in the carnival.","HELEN:                 Right, I’ll do that.","JEREMY:              And then the drawing of the people ice skating in the forest.","HELEN:                 I wasn’t too happy with that one. Because they’re supposed to be skating on grass aren’t they? (Q25)","JEREMY:              That’s right, and it’s frozen over. At the moment it doesn’t look quite right.","HELEN:                 Mm, I <b>see what you mean</b>. I’ll <b>have another</b> go at that.","JEREMY:              And I like the<b> wool </b>hats they’re wearing. Maybe you could give each of them a<b> scarf </b>as well. (Q26)","HELEN:                 Yeah, that’s <b>easy enough</b>. They can be streaming out behind the people to suggest they’re skating <b>really fast</b>.","JEREMY:              Mm, great. Well that’s all on the drawings.","HELEN:                 Right. So you’ve finished writing your story and I <b>just need</b> to finish illustrating it, and my story and your drawings are done.","———————–","HELEN:                 So the <b>next thing</b> is to decide what exactly we <b>need to write</b> about in the report that goes with the stories, and how we’re going to divide the work.","JEREMY:              Right, Helen.","HELEN:                 What <b>do you think</b> about including a section on how we planned the project as a whole, Jeremy? That’s probably quite important.","JEREMY:              Yeah. Well, you’ve had most of the <b><b>good idea</b>s</b> so far. How do you feel about drafting something (Q27), then we can go through it together and discuss it?","HELEN:                 OK, that seems reasonable. And I could <b>include something</b> on how we <b>came up</b> with the ideas for our two stories, couldn’t I?","JEREMY:              Well, I’ve started writing something about that, so why don’t you <b>do the same</b> and we can include the <b>two things</b>. (Q28)","HELEN:                 Right. So what about our<b> interpretation </b>of the stories? Do we <b>need to write</b> about what we think they show, like the value of <b>helping other</b> people, all that <b>sort of thing</b>?","JEREMY:              That’s going to <b>come up</b> later isn’t it? I think everyone in the class is going to read <b>each other</b>’s stories and <b>come up</b> with their own<b> interpretations </b>which we’re <b>going to discuss</b>. (Q29)","HELEN:                 Oh, I missed that. So it isn’t <b>going to be part</b> of the report at all?","JEREMY:              No. But we <b>need to write</b> about the illustrations, because they’re an essential element of children’s experience of reading the stories. It’s probably easiest for you to write that section, as you know more about drawing than I do.","HELEN:                 Maybe, but I find it <b>quite hard</b> to write about. I’d be happier if you did it. (Q30)","JEREMY:              OK. So when <b>do you think</b> …","#4 <b>Ethnography in business</b> Transcript","The Part 4 <b>audio script</b> of <b>Ethnography in business</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 3 is as follows:","So what I’m <b>going to talk</b> about to you today is something called Ethnography. This is a <b>type of research</b> aimed at<b> exploring </b>the way <b>human cultures</b> work. It was <b>first developed</b> for use in anthropology, and it’s <b>also been used</b> in sociology and communication studies. So what’s it got to do with business, you may ask. Well, businesses are finding that<b> ethnography </b>can offer them <b>deeper insight</b> into the possible needs of customers, either present or future, as <b>well as providing</b> valuable information about their attitudes towards <b>existing products</b> (Q31). And<b> ethnography </b>can <b>also help</b> companies to design new <b>products or services</b> that customers really want.","Let’s <b>look at <b>some examples</b></b> of how <b>ethnographic research</b> works in business. One <b>team of researchers</b> did a project for a company manufacturing kitchen equipment. They watched how cooks used <b>measuring cups</b> to measure out <b>things like</b> <b>sugar and flour</b>. They saw that the cooks <b>had to check</b> and recheck the contents, because although the <b>measuring cups</b> had numbers inside them, the cooks couldn’t see these easily (Q32). So a <b>new design</b> of cup was developed to overcome this problem, and it was a top seller.","<b>Another team</b> of <b>ethnographic research</b>ers looked at how cell phones were used in Uganda, in Africa. They <b>found that people</b> who didn’t <b>have their own</b> phones could pay to use the phones of local entrepreneurs. Because these customers paid in advance for their calls, they were eager to <b>know how much</b> time they’d spent on the call so far (Q33). So the phone company designed phones for use globally with this added feature.","<b>Ethnographic research</b> <b>has also</b> been carried out in computer companies. In one company, IT systems administrators were observed for several weeks. It was found that a <b>large amount</b> of their work involved communicating with colleagues in order to solve problems, but that they didn’t have a standard way of <b>exchanging information</b> from spreadsheets and so on. So the team <b>came up</b> with an idea for software that would help them to do this. (Q34)","In <b>another piece</b> of research, a team observed and talked to nurses working in hospitals. This led to the recognition that the nurses needed to access the computer records of their patients, <b>no matter</b> where they were (Q35). This <b>led to the development</b> of a portable computer tablet that allowed the nurses to check records in locations throughout the hospital.","Occasionally, research can be done even in environments where the researchers can’t be present. For example, in one project done for an airline,<b> respondents </b>used their smartphones to <b>record information</b> during airline trips, in a study aiming at tracking the emotions of passengers during a flight. (Q36)","———————","So what makes studies like these <b><b>different from ordinary</b> research</b>? Let’s <b>look at some</b> of the general<b> principles </b>behind <b>ethnographic research</b> in business. <b>First of all</b>, the researcher has to be completely open-minded – he or she hasn’t thought up a<b> hypothesis </b>to be tested, as is the case in <b>other types</b> of research. Instead they wait for the participants in the research to inform them.","As far as choosing the participants themselves is concerned, that’s not <b>really all</b> that <b><b>different from ordinary</b> research</b> – the criteria according to which the participants are chosen may be <b>something as simple</b> as the age bracket they fall into, or the researchers may select them according to their income (Q37), or they might try to find a set of people who all use a particular product, for example. But it’s absolutely crucial to<b> recruit </b>the <b>right people</b> as participants.","As well as the criteria I’ve mentioned, they have to be comfortable talking about themselves and being watched as they go about their activities (Q38). Actually, <b>most researchers</b> say that people <b>open up</b> pretty easily, maybe because they’re <b>often in their own</b> home of workplace.","So what makes this <b>type of research</b> special is that it’s not just a matter of sending a questionnaire to the participants, instead the research is usually based on first-hand observation of what they are doing at the time (Q39). But that doesn’t mean that the researcher never talks to the participants. However, unlike in traditional research, in this case it’s the participant rather than the researchers who decides what direction the interview will follow. This means that there’s less<b> likelihood </b>of the researcher<b> imposing </b>his or her own ideas on the participant.","But after they’ve said goodbye to their participants and <b>got back</b> to their office, the researchers’ work isn’t finished. <b>Most researchers</b><b> estimate </b>that 70 to 80 <b>per cent</b> of their time is spent not on the collecting of data but on its analysis – looking at photos listening to recording and<b> transcribing </b>them and so on (Q40).

My name’s Greg, and I’ll tell you about the various collections as we go round. But before we go, <b>let <b>me just</b></b> give you a taste of what we have here.","Well, for <b>one thing</b>, we have a <b>fine collection</b> of<b> twentieth </b>and twenty-<b>first century</b> paintings, many by <b>very well</b>-known artists. I’m sure you’ll recognise several of the paintings. This is the gallery that attracts the largest <b>number of visitors</b> (Q11), so it’s best to go in early in the day, before the crowds arrive.","The there are the nineteenth-century paintings. The museum was opened in the middle of that century, and several of the artists each donated one work (Q12) – to get the museum started, as it were. So they’re of special interest to us – we feel closer to them than to other works.","The<b> sculpture </b><b>gallery has</b> a number of fine exhibits, but I’m afraid it’s currently closed for refurbishment. You’ll need to come <b>back next</b> year to see it properly, but a number of the<b> sculptures </b>have been moved to <b>other parts</b> of the museum. (Q13)","‘A<b>round the world</b>’ is a<b> temporary </b>exhibition – you’ve <b>probably seen</b> something about it on TV or in the newspapers (Q14). It’s created a <b>great deal</b> of interest, because it presents objects from <b>every continent</b> and <b>many countries</b>, and provides information about their<b> social </b>context – why they were made, who for, and so on.","Then there’s the collection of coins. This is what you might call a focused,<b> specialist </b>collection, because all the coins come from this country, and were produced between <b>two thousand</b> and a <b>thousand years</b> ago. And many of them were discovered by <b>ordinary people</b><b> digging </b>their gardens and donated to the museum! (Q15)","All our<b> porcelain </b>and glass we left to the museum by its founder (Q16), when he died in 1878. And in the terms of his will, we’re not allowed to add anything to that collection: he believed it was perfect in itself, and we don’t see <b>any reason</b> to disagree!","——————–","OK, that was something about the collections, and now here’s some more practical information, in case you need it. Most of the museum<b> facilities </b>are downstairs, in the basement, so you <b>go down</b> the stairs here. When you <b>reach the bottom</b> of the stairs, you’ll <b>find yourself</b> in a sitting area, with comfortable chairs and sofas where you can <b>have a rest</b> before continuing your<b> exploration </b>of the museum.","We <b>have a very</b> good restaurant, which serves <b>excellent food</b> <b>all day</b>, in a relaxing atmosphere. To reach it, when you get to the bottom of the stairs, go <b>straight ahead</b> to the far <b>side of the sitting</b> area, then <b>turn right</b> into the corridor. You’ll see the door on the restaurant facing you (Q17).","If you <b>just want</b> a snack, or if you’d like to eat somewhere with<b> facilities </b>for children, we <b>also have</b> a café. When you <b>reach the bottom</b> of the stairs, you’ll <b>need to go</b> <b>straight ahead</b>, <b>turn right</b> into the corridor, and the café is immediately on the right. (Q18)","And talking about children, there are baby-changing<b> facilities </b>downstairs: cross the sitting area, continue <b>straight ahead</b> along the corridor on the left and you and your body will find the<b> facilities </b>on the left-hand side. (Q19)","The<b> cloakroom </b>where you should leave coats, umbrella and any large bags, is on the <b>left hand</b> <b>side of the sitting</b> area. It’s through the last door before you come to the corridor. (Q20)","There are toilets on every floor, but in the basement they’re the first rooms on the left when you get down there.","OK, now if you’ve <b>got any</b>thing to leave in the cloakroom, <b>please do</b> that now, and then we’ll <b>start our tour</b>.","#3 Joanna’s <b>psychology study</b> Transcript","The Part 3 <b>audio transcript</b> of Joanna’s <b>psychology study</b> in Cambridge 11 <b>Listening Test</b> 4 is as follows:","SUPERVISOR:      Hi, Joanna, good to meet you. Now, before we discuss your new <b>research project</b>. I’d like to <b>hear something</b> about the <b>psychology study</b> you did <b>last year</b> for your Master’s degree. So how <b>did you choose</b> your subjects for that?","JOANNA:             Well, I had six subjects, all professional musicians, and all female. There were<b> violinists </b>and there was also a<b> cello </b>player and a<b> pianist </b>and a <b>flute player</b>. They were <b>all very</b> <b>highly regarded</b> in the music world and they’d done <b>quite extensive</b> tours in different<b> continents </b>(Q21&Q22), and <b>quite a few</b> had won prizes and competitions as well.","SUPERVISOR:      And they were quite young, weren’t they?","JOANNA:             Yes, between 25 and 29 – the mean was 27.8. I wasn’t specifically look for artists who’d produced recordings, but this is something that’s just <b>taken for granted</b> these days, and they <b>all had</b>. (Q21&Q22)","SUPERVISOR:      Right. Now you collected your data through telephone interviews, didn’t you?","JOANNA:             Yes. I realised if I was <b>going to interview</b> leading<b> musicians </b>it’s only be possible over the phone because they’re so busy (Q23&Q24). I recorded them using a telephone recording adaptor. I’d been worried about the quality, but it worked out <b>all right</b>. I managed at least a 30-minute interview with each subject, sometimes longer.","SUPERVISOR:      Did doing it on the phone make it more stressful?","JOANNA:             I’d thought it might … it was all quite informal though and in fact they seemed very keen to talk. And I don’t think using the phone meant I got less rich <b>data rather</b> the<b> opposite </b>in fact. (Q23&Q24)","SUPERVISOR:      Interesting. And you were looking at how performers dress for concert performances?","JOANNA:             That’s right. My research investigated the way players see their role as a<b> musician </b>and how this is linked to the type of clothing they decide to wear. But that focus didn’t<b> emerge </b>immediately. When I started I was more interested in trying to investigate the impact of what was worn on those listening (Q25&Q26), and <b>also whether</b> <b>someone like</b> a<b> violinist </b>might adopt a different style of clothing from, say, someone playing the flute or the<b> trumpet </b>(Q25&Q26).","SUPERVISOR:      It’s interesting that the <b>choice of dress</b> is up to the individual, isn’t it?","JOANNA:             Yes, you’d expect there to be rules about it in orchestras, but that’s <b>quite rare</b>.","——————————","SUPERVISOR:      You only had <b>women performers</b> in your study. Was that because male<b> musicians </b>are less worried about fashion?","JOANNA:             I <b>think a lot</b> of the men are <b>very much</b> influenced by fashion, but in <b>social terms</b> the choices they have are more limited … they’d <b>really up</b>set audiences if they<b> strayed </b>away from quite narrow boundaries. (Q27)","SUPERVISOR:      Hmm. Now, <b>popular music</b> has <b>quite different</b> expectations. <b>Did you read</b> Mike Frost’s article about the dress of <b>women performers</b> in <b>popular music</b>?","JOANNA:             No.","SUPERVISOR:      He points out that a lot of female singers and<b> musicians </b>in <b>popular music</b> tend to dress down in performances, and wear less<b> feminine </b>clothes, <b>like jeans</b> instead of skirts, and he suggests this is <b>beca<b>use other</b>wise</b> they’d just be discounted as trivial. (Q28)","JOANNA:             But you could argue they’re just wearing what’s practical … I mean, a pop-music concert is usually a pretty energetic affair.","SUPERVISOR:      Yes, he doesn’t make that point, but I think you’re <b>probably right</b>. I was interested by the effect of the audience at a musical performance when it came to the <b>choice of dress</b>.","JOANNA:             The subjects I interviewed felt this was <b>really important</b>. It’s <b>all to do</b> with what we understand by performance as a public event. They believed the audience had certain expectations and it was up to them as performers to<b> fulfil </b>these expectations to show a kind of<b> esteem </b>… (Q29)","SUPERVISOR:      … they weren’t afraid of looking as if they’d made an effort to <b>look good</b>.","JOANNA:             Mmm. I think in the past the audience would <b>have had</b> those expectation of <b>one another</b> too, but that’s not really the case now, not in the UK anyway.","SUPERVISOR:      No.","JOANNA:             And I also <b>got interested</b> in what sports scientists are doing too, with regard to clothing.","SUPERVISOR:     <b> Musicians </b>are quite<b> vulnerable </b>physically, aren’t they, because the movements they carry out are very intensive and repetitive, so I’d imagine some features of sports clothing could<b> safeguard </b>the players from the <b>potentially dangerous</b> effects of this <b>sort of thing</b>. (Q30)","JOANNA:             Yes, but<b> musicians </b>don’t really consider it. They avoid clothing that obviously restricts their movements, but that’s as far as they go.","SUPERVISOR:      Anyway, <b>coming back</b> to your own research, <b><b><b>do you have</b> any</b> idea</b> where you’re going from here?","JOANNA:             I was <b>thinking of doing</b> a study using an audience, including ..","#4 <b>Use of <b>soil to <b>reduce <b>carbon <b>dioxide in atmosphere</b></b></b></b></b> Transcript","The Part 4 <b>audio script</b> of The <b>Use of <b>soil to <b>reduce <b>carbon <b>dioxide in atmosphere</b></b></b></b></b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 4 is as follows:","As we saw in the last lecture, a major cause of <b>climate change</b> is the rapid rise in the level of <b>carbon <b>dioxide in the atmosphere</b></b> over the last century. If we could <b>reduce the amount</b> of CO2, perhaps the rate of <b>climate change</b> could also be slowed down. <b>One potential</b> method involves enhancing the role of the soil that <b>plants grow</b> in, with regard to absorbing CO2. Rattan Lal, a <b>soil scientist</b> from Ohio Stage University, in the USA, claims that the world’s agricultural soils could potentially absorb 13 <b>per cent</b> of the <b>carbon <b>dioxide in the atmosphere</b></b> – the equivalent of the amount released in the last 3o years. And <b>research is going</b> on into how this might be achieved.","Lal first came to the idea that soil might be valuable in this way not through an interest in <b>climate change</b>, but rather out of concern for the land itself and the people dependent on it. Carbon-rich soil is dark,<b> crumbly </b>and fertile, and retains <b>some water</b>. But erosion can occur if soil is dry (Q31), which is a likely effect if it contains<b> inadequate </b>amounts of carbon. Erosion is of course bad for people trying to grow crops or breed animals on that terrain. In the 1970s and ‘80s, Lal was studying soils in Africa so<b> devoid </b>of organic matter that the ground <b>had become</b> extremely hard (Q32), like cement. There he met a pioneer in the study of <b>global warming</b>, who suggested that <b>carbon from the soil</b> had moved into the atmosphere. This is now looking increasingly likely.","<b>Let me</b> explain. For <b>millions of years</b>, <b>carbon dioxide</b> levels in the atmosphere have been regulated, in part, by a natural partnership between plants and<b> microbes </b>– tiny organisms in the soil. Plants absorb CO2 from the air and transform it into sugars and other carbon-based substance (Q33). While a proportion of these carbon products remain in the plant, some transfer from the roots to<b> fungi </b>and soil<b> microbes </b>(Q34), which store the carbon in the soil.","The invention of agriculture some 10,000 <b>years ago</b><b> disrupted </b>these ancient soil-building processes and led to the loss of <b>carbon from the soil</b>. When humans started<b> draining </b>the natural topsoil, and<b> ploughing </b>it up for planting, they exposed the buried carbon to oxygen. This created <b>carbon dioxide</b> and released it into the air. And in <b>some places</b>,<b> grazing </b>by domesticated animals has removed all vegetation, releasing carbon into the air. Tons of carbon have been<b> stripped </b>from the world’s soils – where it’s needed – and<b> pumped </b>into the atmosphere.","So what can be done? <b>Researchers are now</b> <b>coming up</b> with evidence that even modest changes to farming can significantly help to <b>reduce the amount</b> of carbon in the atmosphere.","Some growers have <b>already started</b> using an approach known as<b> regenerative </b>agriculture. This aims to boost the<b> fertility </b>of soil and keep it<b> moist </b>through established practices (Q35). These include keeping fields planted <b>all <b>year round</b></b>, and increasing the variety of plants being grown (Q36). Strategies like these can significantly increase the <b>amount of carbon</b> stored in the soil, so agricultural <b>researchers are now</b> building a case for their use in combating <b>climate change</b>.","One American investigation into the potential for storing CO2 on agricultural lands is <b>taking place</b> in California. <b>Soil scientist</b> Whendee Silver of the University of California, Berkeley, is conducting a first-of-its-kind study on a large cattle farm in the state (Q37). She and her students are testing the effects on carbon storage of the<b> compost </b>that is created from waste – both agricultural, including<b> manure </b>and cornstalks, and waste produced in gardens (Q38), such as leaves, branches, and<b> lawn </b>trimmings.","In Australia, soil<b> ecologist </b>Christine Jones is testing another promising soil-enrichment strategy. Jones and 12 farmers are <b>working to build</b> up soil carbon by<b> cultivating </b>grasses that stay green <b>all <b>year round</b></b> (Q39). Like composting, the <b>approach has</b> already been proved experimentally; Jones now hopes to show that it can be applied on working farms and that the resulting carbon capture can be accurately measured.","It’s hoped in the future that <b>projects such</b> as these will demonstrate the role that farmers and other <b>land managers</b> can play in reducing the <b>harmful effects</b> of <b>greenhouse gas</b>es. For example, in countries <b>like the United</b> States, where most farming operations use large applications of fertiliser, changing such long-standing habits will require a change of system. Rattan Lal argues that farmers should receive payment not just for the corn or beef they produce but also for the carbon they can store in their soil.

And of course none of you are allowed to use the electric mixer until you’ve been shown how it works.","Now you may <b>have heard</b> that this can be a stressful job, and I <b>have to say</b> that can be true. You’ll be working an eight-hour day for the <b>first week</b>, though you’ll <b>have the chance</b> to <b>do overtime</b> after that as <b>well if you want</b> to. But however long the hours are, you’ll get a break in the middle.","What you will find is that you’re on your feet <b>all day</b> long, lifting and carrying, so if you’re not fit now you soon will be! You’ll find you don’t <b>have much</b> chance to <b>take it easy</b> – when someone tells you to <b><b>do some</b>thing</b> you <b>need to do</b> it<b> straightaway </b>(Q15&Q16) – but at least we do <b>have a very</b> efficient <b>air conditioning</b> system <b>compared with some</b> kitchens.","——————-","<b>Now <b>let <b>me <b>tell you about some</b></b></b></b> of the people you <b>need to know</b>. So as I said, I’m <b>Joy Parkins</b> and I decide who does what <b>during the day</b> and how long they work for (Q17). I’ll be <b>trying to get</b> you to work with as many <b>different people</b> in the kitchen as possible, so that you learn while you’re on the job.","<b>One person</b> whose name you must remember is David Field. If you injure yourself at all, even if it’s really minor, you must report to him and he’ll <b>make sure</b> the incident is recorded and you get the appropriate treatment (Q18).","He’s trained to give basic treatment to staff himself, or he’ll send you off somewhere else if necessary. Then there’s Dexter Wills – he’s the person you <b>need to see</b> if you<b> smash </b>a plate or <b>something like</b> that (Q19). Don’t <b>just leave</b> it and hope <b>no one</b> will notice – it’s really <b>important to get</b> things noted and replaced or there could be problems late.","And finally, there’s Mike Smith. He’s the <b>member of staff</b> who <b>takes care</b> of all the stores of perishables, so if you notice we’re getting low in flour or sugar or something, <b>make sure</b> you <b>let him</b> know so he can <b>put in an order</b>. (Q20)","OK, now the <b>next thing</b> …","#3 <b>Paper on <b>Public libraries</b></b> Transcript","The Part 3 <b>audio transcript</b> of <b>Paper on <b>Public libraries</b></b> in Cambridge 12 <b>Listening Test</b> 5 is as follows:","TRUDIE:               OK, Stewart. We need to <b>start planning</b> our <b>paper on <b>public libraries</b></b>. Have you thought of an angle yet?","STEWART:           Well, there’s so much we could look into. How libraries <b>have <b>changed over the centuries</b></b>, for instance, or how <b>different countries</b> organise them. What <b>do you think</b>, Trudie?","TRUDIE:               Maybe we should<b> concentrate </b>on this country, and try relate the changes in libraries to<b> external </b>developments, <b>like the fact</b> that <b>far more people</b> can read than a century ago, and that the <b>local population</b> may speak <b>lots of different</b> languages. (Q21)","STEWART:           We could <b>include something</b> about changes in the source of funding, too.","TRUDIE:               Yes, but remember we’re only supposed to write a short paper, so it’s probably best if we don’t go into funding in any detail.","STEWART:           Right. Well, shall we just brainstorm a <b>few ideas</b>, to <b>get started</b>?","TRUDIE:               OK. We obviously <b>need to look</b> at the impact of <b>new technology</b>, particularly the internet. Now that lots of books have been digitalised, people can access them from their own computers at home.","STEWART:           And if everyone did that, libraries would be obsolete.","TRUDIE:               Yes.","STEWART:           But the<b> digitalised </b>books that are <b>available online</b> for free are mostly out of copyright, aren’t they? And copyright in this country lasts for 70 years after the author dies. So you won’t find the latest best-seller or up-to-date information. (Q22)","TRUDIE:               That’s an <b>important point</b>. Anyway, I find it hard to<b> concentrate </b>when I’m reading a long text on a green. I’d much rather read a physical book. And it takes longer to read on a screen.","STEWART:           Oh, I prefer it. I suppose it’s just a personal preference.","TRUDIE:               Mm. I expect that libraries will go on evolving in the <b>next <b>few years</b></b>. Some <b>have already</b> become centres where community activities <b>take place</b>, like local clubs meeting there. I think that’ll become even more common.","STEWART:           I’d like to think so, and that they’ll still be serving their traditional function, but I’m not so sure. There are financial implications, after all. What I’m afraid will happen is that books and magazines will all disappear, and there’ll just be rows and rows of computers (Q23). They won’t look <b>anything like</b> the libraries we’re used to.","TRUDIE:               Well, we’ll see.","———————–","TRUDIE:               I’ve <b>just had</b> an idea. Why don’t we make an in-depth study of our local <b>public library</b> as background to our paper?","STEWART:           Yes, that’d be interesting, and raise <b>all sorts</b> of issues. Let’s <b>make a list</b> of possible things we could ask about, then work out <b>some sort</b> of structure. For instance, um, we could interview some of the staff, and find out whether the library <b>has its own</b> budget, or if that’s controlled by the <b>local council</b>. (Q24)","TRUDIE:               And what their policies are. I know they don’t allow food, but I’d love to find out what <b>types of noise</b> they ban – there always seems to be a lot of talking, but never music. I don’t know if that’s a policy or it just happens.","STEWART:           Ah, I’ve <b>often wondered</b>. Then there are <b>things like</b> how the library is affected by employment laws. I suppose there are rules about working hours,<b> facilities </b>for staff, and so on. (Q25)","TRUDIE:               Right. Then there are <b>other issues</b> relating to the <b>design of the building</b> and how customers use it. Like what measures does the library take to ensure their safety? (Q26) They’d need <b>floor coverings</b> that aren’t slippery, and<b> emergency </b>exits, for instance. Oh, and <b>another thing</b> – there’s the question of the kind of insurance the library <b>needs to have</b>, in case anyone gets injured. (Q27)","STEWART:           Yes, that’s something else to find out. You <b>know something</b> I’ve <b>often wondered</b>?","TRUDIE:               What’s that?","STEWART:           Well, you know they’ve got an archive of <b>local newspapers</b> <b>going back</b> years? Well, next to it they’ve got the diary of a well-known<b> politician </b>from the late 19th century (Q28). I wonder why it’s there. <b>Do you know</b> what his connection was with this area?","TRUDIE:               <b>No idea</b>. Let’s add it to our list of things to find out. Oh, I’ve just thought – you know people might ask in the library about local organisations, like <b>sports clubs</b>? Well, I wonder if they keep a database, or whether they <b>just look</b> online. (Q29)","STEWART:           Right. I quite fancy finding out what the differences are between a library that’s <b>open to the public</b> and one that’s part of a museum, for example (Q30) – they must be <b>very different</b>.","TRUDIE:               Mmm. Then something else I’d <b>like to know</b> is …","#4 <b>Four <b>business values</b></b> Transcript","The Part 4 <b>audio script</b> of <b>Four <b>business values</b></b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 5 is as follows:","In public discussion of business, we take certain values for granted. Today I’m <b>going to talk</b> about four of them: collaboration, <b>hard work</b>, creativity and excellence. <b>Most people</b> would say they’re all ‘<b><b>good thing</b>s</b>’. I’m going to suggest that’s an over-simple view.","The trouble with these values is that they’re<b> theoretical </b>concepts, removed from the reality of day-to-day business. Pursue values by all means, but be prepared for what may happen as a result. They can actually cause damage, which is not at all the intention. (Q31)","<b>Business leaders</b> generally <b>try to do</b> the <b>right thing</b>. But <b>all too</b> often the <b>right thing</b> backfires, if those leaders adopt values without understanding and managing the <b>side effects</b> that arise (Q32). The values can easily <b>get in the way</b> of what’s actually intended.","OK. So the first value I’m <b>going to discuss</b> is collaboration. Er, <b>let <b>me give</b></b> you an example. On a management <b>training course</b> I once attended, we were put into groups and had to construct a bridge across a stream (Q33), using <b><b>building block</b>s</b> that we were given. The rule was that <b>everyone in the team</b> had to move at <b>least one</b> <b>building block</b> during the construction. This was intended to encourage teamwork.","But it was really a job best done by <b>one person</b>. The other teams tried to collaborate on building the structure, and descended into confusion (Q34), with everyone getting in <b>each other</b>’s way. Our <b>team leader</b> solved the challenge brilliantly. She simply asked <b>everyone in the team</b> to move a piece a <b>few centimetres</b>, to comply with the rule, and then let the person in the team with an aptitude for puzzles like this build it alone. We finished before <b>any other</b> team. My point is that the task wasn’t really suited to teamworking, so why make it one?","Teamwork can <b>also lead</b> to<b> inconsistency </b>– a common cause of poor sales. In the case of a smartphone that a certain company launched, <b>one director</b> wanted to target the business market, and another demanded it was aimed at consumers. The company wanted both directors to be involved, so gave the product a consumer-friendly name, but marketed it to companies. The result was that it met the needs of neither group. It would <b>have been better</b> to let <b>one director</b> or the other have his way, not both. (Q35)","Now industriousness, or <b>hard work</b>. It’s easy to mock people who say they work hard: after all, a hamster running around in a wheel is working hard – and getting nowhere. Of course <b>hard work</b> is valuable, but only when properly targeted. Otherwise it wastes the resources that companies value most – <b>time and energy</b>. And that’s bad for the organisation. (Q36)","There’s a management model that groups people according to four criteria: clever, hard-working, stupid and lazy. Here ‘lazy’ means having a<b> rational </b>determination not to carry out unnecessary tasks (Q37). It doesn’t mean <b>trying to avoid</b> <b>work altogether</b>. <b>Most people</b> display two of these characteristics, and the <b>most valuable</b> people are those who are both clever and lazy: they possess intellectual clarity, and they don’t rush into making decisions.","They <b>come up</b> with solutions to save the <b>time and energy</b> spent by the stupid and hard-working group. Instead of throwing more man-hours at a problem, the clever and lazy group looks for a more effective solution.","Next we come to creativity. This often <b>works well</b> – creating an attention-grabbing TV commercial, for example, might lead to increased sales. But it isn’t always a <b>good thing</b>. Some advertising campaigns are remembered for their creativity, without <b>having any</b> effect on sales. This happened a <b><b>few years</b> ago</b> with the launch of a chocolate bar: subsequent research showed that plenty of consumers remembered the adverts, but <b>had <b>no idea</b></b> what was being advertised (Q38). The trouble is that the creator derives pleasure from <b>coming up</b> with the idea, and wrongly assumes the audience for the campaign will share that feeling.","<b>A </b> company that brings out thousands of <b>new products</b> may seem more creative than a company that only has a few, but it may be too creative, and make smaller profits. Creativity needs to be targeted, to solve a problem that the company <b>has identified</b> (Q39). Just <b>coming up</b> with more and more novel products isn’t necessarily a <b>good thing</b>.","And finally, excellence. We <b>all know</b> companies that claim they ‘strive for excellence’, but it takes a <b>long time</b> to achieve excellence. In business, being first with a product is more profitable than having the best product. A major study of company performance compared pioneers – that is, companies bringing out the first version of a particular product – with followers, the companies that copied and improved on that product. The <b>study found</b> that the pioneers commanded an average <b>market share</b> of 29 percent, while the followers achieved less than half that, only 13 percent (Q40) – <b>even though</b> their product might <b>have been better</b>.","Insisting on<b> excellence </b>in <b>everything we do</b> is time-consuming, wastes energy and leads to losing out on opportunities. Sometimes, second-rate work is more worthwhile than excellence. ‘<b>Make sure</b> it’s excellent’ <b>sounds like</b> a good approach to business, but the ‘just-get-started’ approach is likely to be more successful."]},{"name":"GLS/12-2","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Events during Kenton Festival Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of <b>Events <b>during <b>Kenton Festival</b></b></b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 6 is as follows:","MAN:                    <b>Good morning</b>, Kenton <b><b>Festival box</b> office</b>.

I’ve now almost succeeded in finalising plans for our tour, so I’ll <b><b>bring you up</b> to date</b> with what I know.","As you know, we’re flying first to Munich, on Monday the 4th.","The flight is at 11.30, so it’s <b>too early</b> to <b>have lunch</b> at the airport. I suggest we meet there for coffee at 10 (Q11), which should give us <b>plenty of time</b> for breakfast before we leave home.","When we arrive in Munich, we’ll be met at the airport by Claus Bauer. Claus works for a tour operator (Q12), and he’ll look after us for the time we’ll be in Germany. He’s already<b> liaised </b>with the managers of the theatres we’re going to visit, and he’s also arranged for an officer of the National Theatre in Munich to show us round the theatre one afternoon during our stay.","Now <b>last time</b> we discussed this trip, I didn’t have the precise cost for <b>hotel room</b>s, but now I have. The normal rate at the hotel where we’re staying is 150<b> euros </b>a night for a double room. I’d hoped to get that down to 120 euros, but in fact I’ve been able to negotiate a rate of 110 (Q13). That’ll be reflected in the final payment which you’ll <b>need to make</b> by the end of this week.","On Tuesday, the day after our arrival, I had hoped we could sit in on a<b> rehearsal </b>at one of the theatres, but unfortunately that’s proved <b>very difficult</b> to arrange, so instead we’ll have a <b>coach trip</b> to one of the amazing<b> castles </b>in the mountains south of Munich.","On Tuesday evening, we’ll <b>all have</b> dinner together in a restaurant near our hotel. From talking to you all about your preferences, it was clear that a typical local restaurant would be too meat-oriented for some of you. Some of you suggested an Italian restaurant, but I must confess that I decided to book a Lebanese one (Q14), as we have <b>plenty of opportunities</b> to go to an Italian restaurant at home.","On Wednesday afternoon, the director of the play we’re <b>going to see</b> that evening will talk to us at the theatre (Q15). She’ll describe the <b>whole process</b> of producing a play, including how she chose the actors, and, as the play we’re <b>going to see</b> is a modern one, how she worked with the playwright.","——————","Right. Now I’d just <b>like to make</b> a few points about the plays we’re <b>going to see</b>, <b>partly because</b> it might influence your choice of clothes to take with you!","The play we’re seeing on Wednesday evening is a modern one, and we’re going to the<b> premiere </b>(Q16), so it’ll be quite a<b> dressy </b>occasion, <b>though of course</b> you don’t have to <b>dress formally</b>. I gather it’s rather a multimedia production, with amazing lighting effects and a<b> soundtrack </b>of<b> electronic </b>music, though unfortunately the<b> playwright </b>is ill and is unlikely to be <b>able to attend</b>.","On Thursday we’re seeing a play that was first performed <b>last year</b>, when it was<b> commissioned </b>to mark a <b>hundred years</b> since the birth in the town of a well-known scientist (Q17). We’re <b>going to see</b> a<b> revival </b>of that production, which<b> aroused </b>a lot of interest.","Friday’s play will really make you think hard about what clothes to pack, as it’ll be in the garden of a palace (Q18). It’s a beautiful setting, but I’d better warn you, there won’t be much protection from the wind.","On Saturday, we’re going by coach to a theatre in another town, not far from Munich. This will be the opening of a drama festival, and the mayor and <b>all the other</b><b> dignitaries </b>of the town will be attending (Q19). After the performance, the mayor is hosting a reception for all the audience, and there’ll be a band playing traditional music of the region.","And after having a day off on Sunday, our final play is on Monday, and it’s in the<b> stunning </b>setting of the old <b>Town Hall</b>, which <b>dates back</b> to the 14th century (Q20). The performance marks the <b>fifty years</b> that the lead actor has been on stage, and the play is the one where he made his first professional appearance, <b>all those years</b> ago.","And the day after that, we’ll be flying <b>back home</b>. Now <b>have you got</b> <b>any questions</b> before I …","#3 <b>Scandinavian Studies</b> Transcript","The Part 3 <b>audio transcript</b> of <b>Scandinavian Studies</b> in Cambridge 12 <b>Listening Test</b> 6 is as follows:","BETH:                   Oh <b>good morning</b>. You must be James. I’m Beth Cartwright – please call be Beth.","JAMES:                 Thank you.","BETH:                   Now as this is your first tutorial since you started on the <b>Scandinavian Studies</b> course, I’d like to <b>find out something</b> about you. Why did you decide to take this course?","JAMES:                 Well, my mother is Danish, and although we always lived in England, she used to talk about her home a lot, and that <b>made me</b> want to visit Denmark. We <b>hardly ever</b> did, though – my mother usually went on her own. But whenever her relations or friends were in England they always <b>came to see</b> us. (Q21)","BETH:                   I see. So I assume you already speak Danish, one of the languages you’ll be studying.","JAMES:                 I can get by when I talk to people, though I’m not<b> terribly </b>accurate.","BETH:                   Now you probably know that you’ll spend the <b>third year</b> of the course abroad. <b><b>Have you had</b> any</b> thoughts about that?","JAMES:                 I’m really <b>looking forward</b> to it. And although Denmark seems the obvious place to go, because of my family connections, I’d love to spend the time in Iceland.","BETH:                   Oh, I’m sure it can be arranged. <b><b>Do you have</b> any</b> plans for when you graduate? A lot of students go on to take a master’s degree.","JAMES:                 I think the <b>four years</b> of the undergraduate course will be enough for me. I’m interested in journalism, and I quite <b>like the idea</b> of moving to Scandinavia and writing for magazines (Q22). I’d find that more creative than translating, which I suppose most graduates do.","BETH:                   OK. Now how are you finding the courses you’re taking this term, James?","JAMES:                 Well, I’m really enjoying the one on Swedish cinema.","BETH:                   That’ll continue next term, but the one on Scandinavian literature that’s running at the moment will be replaced by more specialised courses (Q23). Oh, and by the way, if you’re interested in watching Danish television programmes – there’s going to be a course on that the term after next.","JAMES:                 That <b>sounds good</b>.","BETH:                   Have you started thinking about the literature paper that you <b>have to write</b> in the next <b>few weeks</b>?","JAMES:                 Yes, my <b>first choice</b> would be to <b><b>do some</b>thing</b> on the Icelandic sagas.","BETH:                   Hmm.

I’ll put you down for that topic.","JAMES:                 Right. So what would you advise me to aim at in the paper?","BETH:                   First I suggest you <b>avoid taking</b> one writer and going into a <b>great deal</b> of detail. That approach certainly has its place, but I think you first <b>need to get</b> an understanding of the literature in the context of the society in which it was produced – who it was written for, how it was published, and so on (Q25). I also think that’s more fruitful than placing it within the history of the genre.","JAMES:                 OK, that sounds reasonable.","————————","JAMES:                 Could I ask for <b>some advice</b> about writing the paper I’m working on about the Vikings?

It’s short and well focused, and I’m sure you’ll find it helpful. I’ll <b>give you the details</b> in a moment. Textbooks usually cover so many topics, it can be <b>very difficult</b> to choose <b>just one</b>.","JAMES:                 OK. I’ve got a DVD of the film about the Vikings that came out earlier this year. Should I watch that again?","BETH:                   If it’s the one I am thinking of, hmm, I’d ignore it – it’s more fantasy than reality. But I’ve got a recording of a documentary that you should watch (Q27).

(Q28)","JAMES:                 Yes. Just headings for different sections, at this stage. And then you should start <b>looking for suitable</b> articles and books to draw on, and <b><b>take no</b>tes</b> (Q29) which you organise according to those headings.","BETH:                   I see.","JAMES:                 Then put short phrases and sentences as bullet points under each heading (Q30). <b>Make sure</b> that this skeleton <b>makes sense</b> and flows properly, before writing up the paper in full.","BETH:                   OK. Thanks, that’s <b>very helpful</b>.","#4 <b>Conflict at work</b> Transcript","The Part 4 <b>audio script</b> of <b>Conflict at work</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 6 is as follows:","Over the years, attitudes towards workers <b>have changed</b> considerably. After all, there was a time when workers <b>had no</b> rights at all, and<b> laboured </b>in<b> appalling </b>conditions. Conditions have <b>improved a lot</b>, but <b>conflict in the workplace</b> is still common. And <b>human resources</b> managers nowadays <b>need to be able</b> to deal with it when necessary.","What is <b>conflict in the workplace</b>? Definitions vary, but I’m taking it to refer to a <b>whole range</b> of behaviours that the victim finds unacceptable, from minor, harmless arguments to – at the<b> opposite </b>extreme – physical violence. Much of this is covered by the term bullying (Q31), by which I mean one or more people behaving<b> abusively </b>or aggressively against another who is in a weaker position. <b>Although all</b> behaviour like this is a form of conflict, not all conflict can be described in these terms.","As with <b>all human</b> behaviour, there are<b> numerous </b>reasons for it. But often it’s caused by someone who feels the need to show their<b> superiority </b>over someone else (Q32), in order to feel that they aren’t at the lowest level in a hierarchy or a <b>group of people</b>.","In <b>some cases</b> <b>one person</b> simply dislikes the other, on the basis that the personality of one is in <b>some way</b><b> incompatible </b>with that of the other person (Q33). A general habit of<b> optimism </b>in <b>one person</b> could make them<b> intolerant </b>of a colleague who’s constantly<b> pessimistic </b>– not that that justifies treating them badly, of course.","Some conflicts arise when people are more interested in promoting themselves and their team than in the <b>company as a whole</b>. These conflicts are called ‘structural’ (Q34), and could come about, for example, when a sales team believe they are the <b>only people</b> in the business who <b>do any</b> useful work, and <b>look down</b> on behind-the-scenes administrators.","Conflict obviously affects the individuals concerned – the situation is likely to be very stressful for victims, resulting in their absence from work, possibly for months (Q35). For the company, if no effort is made to deal with conflict, it can<b> spiral </b>out of control, and <b>even lead</b> to the breakdown of the business.","<b>Some interesting</b> work with <b><b>chief executive</b>s</b> – CEOs – has uncovered some of the reasons why they may treat colleagues badly. Many CEOs combine two<b> opposing </b>characteristics: confidence – that is, the belief that they’re capable of great achievements – with a <b>high level</b> of anxiety (Q36), a fear of missing targets, whether set by themselves or by the directors of the company. This combination can make them respond badly to anyone who questions their decisions.","In a high pressure <b>work environment</b>, such characteristics become problematic. And it’s particularly difficult to<b> tackle </b>the situation where colleagues, managers and <b>board members</b> are all trying to achieve their own visions. When they can’t agree on strategic issues and on where they see the business going, there are real problems. (Q37)","For managers at lower levels within the organisation, it might seem that an<b> autocratic </b>form of management – where the <b>chief executive</b> gives orders and everyone else has to obey – would see more conflict than others. Interestingly, though, a company with a more<b> democratic </b>business model, can suffer more, when uncertainly about who to report to leads to conflicting demands. (Q38)","Now I’ll <b>say a little</b> about dealing with the type of conflict that has <b>harmful effects</b>. Of course the ideal is to prevent it arising in the <b>first place</b>. A good manager, at any level, will make efforts to earn the respect of the people they work with (Q39), particularly those who report to them. That will involve<b> politeness </b>in all communications, and treating them as equals who <b>happen to have</b> a <b>different role</b> within the organisation.","Sometimes, of course, conflict does occur, and can <b>get out of hand</b>. In such cases the <b>human <b>resources department</b></b> often <b>gets involved</b>. However, if one of the parties in a conflict sees <b>human resources</b> as simply a<b> mouthpiece </b>for the <b>chief executive</b>, then an<b> external </b>mediator might be <b>able to help</b> (Q40). By talking to both sides, and trying to find the truth of what’s been happening, they can build a <b>clear picture</b> of the situation, and give feedback that both sides will accept, <b>precisely because</b> they’re independent."]},{"name":"GLS/12-3","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Public library Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of <b>Public library</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 7 is as follows:","SUSIE:   Hello?","PAUL:    Hi, Susie, it’s Paul here.

Now, the travel business is <b>very competitive</b> and it’s important to be aware of how the market’s changing and developing. In terms of <b>age groups</b>, the over-65s are an important market, and one that’s increasing steadily year on year (Q11&Q12).","The fewest holidays are taken by the 31 to 42-year-olds, and that figure <b>shows no</b> sign of rising. The biggest market at present is still the youngest group, the 16 to 30s, but this group’s <b>also see</b>n the biggest drop over the last <b>few years</b>, whereas there’s a noticeable growth in the number of <b>holidays take</b>n by the 55 to 64-year-olds (Q11&12). As far as the 43 to 54-year-olds are concerned, bookings there are steady, but I <b>have to say</b> we haven’t seen the increase we expected.","<b>One trend</b> we’re noticing with <b>nearly all</b> <b>age groups</b> is the <b>growing popularity</b> of holidays in which clients do <b>some kind</b> of specialised activity. I’m not talking here about adventure holidays, where clients <b>take part</b> in high-risk activities like white water<b> rafting </b>just for the thrill of it. <b>Activity holidays</b> usually involve <b>rather less</b> high-risk sports, or <b>things like</b> art and music.","They’re not necessarily cheaper than ordinary holidays, often the opposite, in fact. But they do often <b>take place</b> outside the main tourist centres, which gives an opportunity for clients to find out more about the <b>local people</b> and customs (Q13&Q14), and many say this is <b>one of the most</b> positive features of these holidays.","Of course, they offer the chance to develop a new skill or talent, but clients often say that more than this, it’s the chance to create lasting <b>relationships with other</b> like-minded people that’s the main draw. (Q13&Q14)","<b>Let <b>me <b>give you some</b></b></b> examples of <b>BC Travel</b> <b>activity holidays</b>. Our painting <b><b>holidays take</b> place</b> in <b>four different</b> centres in France and Italy and they’re <b>very popular</b> with clients of all abilities from beginners onwards. We’ve got an<b> excellent </b>team of artists to lead the classes – <b>some of them have</b> been with us from the start, and five additional ones will be joining us this year (Q15) so that we can offer a <b>greater number</b> of classes in each centre.","As far as cooking holidays are concerned, I <b>know a lot</b> of agents offer holidays where clients cook recipes related to <b><b>one part</b>icular</b> country, usually the one they’re staying in, but we focus on dishes from a <b>great many</b> <b>different ones</b> (Q16). Apart from that you’ll find the usual<b> emphasis </b>on <b>good quality</b>, organic ingredients – that’s more or less a given nowadays – and there are generally some meat-free recipes included.","Our<b> photography </b><b><b>holidays take</b> place</b> in a <b>wide range</b> of countries from Iceland to Vietnam, and clients <b>have the opportunity</b> to <b>see some</b> <b>stunning scenery</b>. Groups are small, no more than eight, so clients can <b>have one</b>-on-one tuition during the holiday (Q17), and<b> excursions </b>are arranged with fully-trained guides. At the <b>end of each</b> holiday an exhibition is held of the<b> photographs </b>taken so that clients can see <b>one another</b>’s work and receive valuable feedback from the tutor.","——————–","Finally, <b>let <b>me tell</b></b> you about our <b>fitness holidays</b>. In Ireland and Italy we run one-week general fitness classes for <b>all ages</b> and levels of fitness. Clients start the course with a consultation with a trainer, and together they <b>draw up</b> an individual programme. As <b>well as improving</b> general fitness, clients find that they <b>end up</b> losing much of the stress they’ve <b>built up</b> in their daily lives. (Q18)","In Greece, we have a two-week holiday for clients who <b>want to <b><b>do some</b>thing</b></b> about their weight (Q19). This has <b>all the features</b> you’d expect, like a<b> personalised </b>diet programme, but one of its <b>most popular</b> features is that the exercise classes are all held on the beach. <b>People say</b> it’s far preferable to being in a gym.","Finally, we offer several holidays in Morocco. <b><b>One <b>very popular</b></b> one</b> is the mountain biking holiday. Bikes are provided and there are <b><b>different routes</b> according</b> to people’s ability. We offer one which is tailored to the needs of families (Q20), which is particularly popular.","OK, so that’s about <b>all the time</b> I have today, so <b><b>thank you very</b> much</b> …","#3 The <b><b>Horton Castle</b> site</b> Transcript","The Part 3 <b>audio transcript</b> of The <b><b>Horton Castle</b> site</b> in Cambridge 12 <b>Listening Test</b> 7 is as follows:","NATALIE:             Dave, I’m worried about our <b>case study</b>. I’ve done a bit of reading, but I’m not sure what’s involved in actually writing a <b>case study</b> – I missed the lecture where <b>Dr Baker</b> talked us through it.","DAVE:                   OK, well it’s <b>quite straightforward</b>. We’ve got our focus – that’s tourism at the <b><b>Horton Castle</b> site</b>. And you said you’d <b>done some</b> reading about it.","NATALIE:             Yes, I found some articles and made notes of the <b>main point</b>s.","DAVE:                   Did you remember to keep a record of where you got the information from? (Q21)","NATALIE:             Sure. I know what a pain it is when you forget that.","DAVE:                   OK, so we can compare what we’ve read. Then we <b>have to decide</b> on a particular <b>problem or need</b> at our site. And then think about who we’re <b>going to interview</b> to <b>get more information</b>.","NATALIE:             OK. So who’d that be? The people who work there (Q22)? And<b> presumable </b>some of the tourists too?","DAVE:                   Yes, both those groups. So we’ll <b>have to go</b> to the site to do that, I suppose. But we might <b>also do</b> some of our interviewing away from the site – we could even contact <b>some people</b> <b>here in the city</b>, like administrators involved in overseeing tourism. (Q23)","NATALIE:             OK. So we’ll <b>need to think</b> about our interview questions and fix times and places for the meetings. It’s all <b>going to take</b> a <b>lot of time</b>.","DAVE:                   Mmm. And if we can, we should ask our interviewees if they can bring along some<b> numerical </b>data that we can add to support our findings.","NATALIE:             And photographs?","DAVE:                   I <b>think we have</b> plenty of those already. But <b>Dr Baker</b> <b>also said</b> we have to establish with our interviewees whether we can identify them in our <b>case study</b>, or whether they want to be anonymous. (Q24)","NATALIE:             Oh, I wouldn’t <b>have thought</b> of that. OK, once we’ve <b>got all</b> this information, I suppose we <b>have to analyse</b> it.","DAVE:                   Yes, put it all together and choose what’s<b> relevant </b>to the problem we’re focusing on, and analyse that carefully to find out if we can <b>identify any</b> trends or regularities (Q25) there. That’s the <b>main thing</b> at this stage, rather can<b> concentrating </b>on details or lots of facts.","NATALIE:             OK. And then once we’ve analysed that, what next?","DAVE:                   Well, then we <b>need to think</b> about what we do with the data we’ve selected to make it as clear as possible to our readers. <b>Things like</b> graphs, or tables, or charts.","NATALIE:             Right.","DAVE:                   Then the <b>case study</b> itself is mostly quite standard; we begin by presenting the problem, and giving some background, then <b>go through the main</b> sections, but the thing that <b>surprised me</b> is that in a normal report we’d end with some suggestions to deal with the <b>problem or need</b> we identified, but in a <b>case study</b> we <b>end up</b> with a question or a series of questions to our readers, and they decide what ought to be done. (Q26)","NATALIE:             Oh, I hadn’t realised that.","————————–","NATALIE:             So basically, the problem we’re addressing in our <b>case study</b> of the <b><b>Horton Castle</b> site</b> is why so few tourists are visiting it. And we’ll find out more from our interviews, but I <b>did find</b> one report on the internet that <b>suggested that one</b> reason might be because as far as transport goes, access is difficult.","DAVE:                   I read that too, but that report was actually written <b>ten years</b> ago, when the road there was <b>really bad</b>, but that’s been improved now. And I think there’s plenty of fascinating stuff there for a <b>really good</b> day out, but you’d never realise it from the<b> castle </b>website – maybe that’s the problem. (Q27)","NATALIE:             Yes, it’s really dry and boring.","DAVE:                   I read somewhere a suggestion that what the<b> castle </b>needs is a <b>visitor centre</b>. So we could <b>have a look</b> for <b>some information</b> about that on the internet. What would we <b>need to know</b>?","NATALIE:             Well, who’d use it for a start. It’s be <b>good to know</b> what categories the visitors fell into too, like school parties or retired people, but I think we’d have to talk to staff to get that information.","DAVE:                   OK. And as we’re thinking of suggesting a <b>visitor centre</b> we’d also <b>have to look</b> at potential problems. I mean, obviously it wouldn’t be cheap to <b>set up</b>.","NATALIE:             No, but it could be a <b>really good</b> investment. And as it’s on a historical site it’d <b>need to get</b> special planning permission, I expect. That might be hard. (Q28)","DAVE:                   Right, especially as the only possible place for it would be at the entrance, and that’s right in front of the castle.","NATALIE:             Mmm.","DAVE:                   But it could be a <b>good thing</b> for the town of Horton. At present it’s a bit of a ghost town. Once they’ve <b>left school</b> and <b>got any</b> skills or qualifications, the <b>young people</b> all get out as fast as they can to get jobs in the city, and the <b>only people</b> left are children and those who’ve retired. (Q29)","NATALIE:             Right. Something else we could investigate would be the potential damage that tourists might cause to the <b>castle site</b>, I mean their <b>environmental impact</b>. At present the tourists can just wander round wherever they want, but if numbers increase, there might have to be some restrictions, like<b> sticking </b>to marked ways. And there’d need to be guides and<b> wardens </b>around to <b>make sure</b> these were enforced. (Q30)","DAVE:                   Yes, we could <b>look at that too</b>. OK, well …","#4 <b><b><b>Effects of environmental</b> change</b> on birds</b> Transcript","The Part 4 <b>audio script</b> of <b><b><b>Effects of environmental</b> change</b> on birds</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 7 is as follows:","OK, so we’ve been looking at how man-made changes in our environment can affect wildlife. Now I’ll discuss a <b>particular example</b>. Let’s <b>take a look</b> at mercury. Mercury’s one of the 120 or so elements that <b>make up</b> all matter, and it has the symbol Hg. It’s a shiny,<b> silvery </b>substance. You may <b>have seen</b> it in old-fashioned thermometers, but it’s not used much for domestic purposes <b>now because</b> it’s highly toxic.","But the problem is that the amount of<b> mercury </b>in the environment’s increasing. The <b>main reason</b> for this is the power <b>plants used</b> to <b>produce electricity</b>. The main <b>source of energy</b> that most of them use is still coal, and when it’s burned it releases<b> mercury </b>into the atmosphere.","Some of this gets deposited into lakes and rivers, and if it’s<b> ingested </b>by a fish it’s not excreted, it stays in the fish’s body and it enters the food chain. So it’s been known for <b>some time</b> that birds which eat fish may be affected, but what wasn’t known until quite recently is that those that eat insects can also be affected. (Q31)","So a woman called Claire Varian-Ramos is <b>doing <b>some research</b></b> on how this is affecting birds.","And rather than looking at how <b>many birds</b> are actually killed by<b> mercury </b>poisoning, she’s looking for more subtle sub-effects. These may be to do with the behaviour of the birds, or with the effect of<b> mercury </b>on the way their brain works, so whether it leads to problems with memory, for example (Q32). And she’s particularly focusing on the effects of<b> mercury </b>on bird song. Now, the process of <b>song learning</b> happens at a particular stage in the birds’ development, and what you may not know is that a young bird seems to acquire this skill by listening to the songs produced by its father (Q33), rather than by any <b>other bird</b>.","And Varian-Ramos <b>has already</b> found in her research that if young <b>male birds</b> are exposed to mercury, if they <b>eat food</b><b> contaminated </b>with mercury, then the songs they produce aren’t as complex as those produced by <b>other bird</b>s (Q34). So quite low-level<b> exposure </b>to<b> mercury </b>is <b>likely to have</b> an impact on <b>male birds</b> in a natural situation, because it can mean that they’re less attractive to fe<b>male birds</b>, and so it can affect their chances of reproduction. (Q35)","Now the way she’s carrying out this research is worth thinking about. She’s using a mixture of studies using birds kept in laboratories, and studies carried out outdoors in the wild. The lab-based <b>studies have</b> the advantage that you don’t <b>g<b>et al</b>l</b> the variables you would in a natural setting, so the<b> experimenter </b>has a <b>much <b>higher level</b></b> of control (Q36), and that means they can be more confident about their results in <b><b>some way</b>s</b>. And of course they don’t have to worry about going out and finding the birds in order to observe them.","So what are the implications here for humans? Well, <b>because many</b> birds are migratory, they may be transporting<b> mercury </b>far from<b> contaminated </b>sites. For example, it’s been found that ducks who’d been feeding at a<b> contaminated </b>site were later shot by hunters over a thousand kilometres away, and<b> presumably </b>eaten (Q37). But these <b>birds like</b>ly had<b> mercury </b>levels <b>high enough</b> to warrant concern for <b>human consumption</b>.","In addition, <b>going back</b> to <b>song learning</b> by birds, we saw that this may be affected by <b>mercury contamination</b>. Well, we also know that in humans,<b> mercury </b>causes developmental delays in the acquisition of language (Q38), and in fact this process is <b>very similar</b> in the brain regions it involves and even the genes that are involved. But <b>mercury contamination</b> has other important implication for humans as well. It’s <b>now known</b> that an<b> unborn </b>child can be affected if the food eaten by its mother contains <b><b>high level</b>s</b> of<b> mercury </b>(Q39), and these effects can be quite substantial.","In the end, it <b>comes down</b> to whether more value is placed on human economic wellbeing or environmental wellbeing. It’s true there are <b>new regulations</b> for mercury<b> emissions </b>from power plants, but these will need billions of dollars to implement, and increase costs for everyone (Q40). <b>Some argue</b> that’s <b>too much</b> to pay to protect wildlife.

I’ve seen your advert for people to lead <b>cycle trips</b>. Are you the <b>right person</b> to speak to?","BOB:                     Yes, I am. Could I <b>have your name</b>, please?","MARGARET:        It’s Margaret Smith. (Example)","BOB:                     Are you looking for a <b>permanent job</b>, Margaret? (Q1)","MARGARET:        No, temporary.

I’ve <b>just <b>finished my training</b></b>.","BOB:                     Right. And <b><b>have you had</b> any</b> experience of leading <b>cycle trips</b>?","MARGARET:        Yes, I’ve led several bike tours in Africa (Q3). The trip to India that I had arranged to lead <b>next month</b> <b><b>has no</b>w</b> been cancelled, so when I saw you were advertising for tour leaders, I decided to apply.","BOB:                     OK. Now we normally <b>have two</b> or <b>three leaders</b> on a trip, depending on the size of the group. Some tours are for very experienced cyclists, but we’ve got a tour <b>coming up</b> soon in Spain, which is proving so popular we need an additional leader. It’s a cycling holiday for families.

As its name suggests, there was originally a market here where farmers brought their sheep, but now it’s been<b> redeveloped </b>into a buzzing, vibrant area of the city, which is <b>also home</b> to one of the city’s fastest-growing communities. The nearby <b>university has</b> always meant the area’s popular with students, who come in to enjoy the lively nightlife, but now graduates embarking on careers in the worlds of fashion and design are buying up the new apartments <b>recently built</b> here to replace the small houses where the market workers used to live. (Q11)","The narrow old side streets are great places for finding original pictures,<b> jewellery </b>and<b> ceramics </b>(Q12) which won’t break the bank, as well as local produce like <b>fruit and vegetables</b>. There’s also lots of<b> pavement </b>cafes where you can have a coffee and watch tourists from <b>all over the world</b> go by. The oldest buildings in the area are on the main streets, including the city’s first department store, built in the 1880s, which is still open today.","The Sheepmarket is a centre for fashion, and there’s a policy of encouraging new <b>young designers</b>. The <b>Young Fashion</b> <b>competition is open</b> to local young <b>people who are passionate</b> about fashion. This year they’ve been asked to design an outfit based on ideas from the music and technology that’s part of their <b>everyday life</b> (Q13), using both natural and man-made fibres. The garments will be judged by a panel of experts and <b>fashion designer</b>s, and the winning entries will be modelled at a special<b> gala </b>evening.","Parking at the Sheepmarket is easy. There are plenty of pay and display <b>car <b>parking spaces</b></b> on the<b> roadsides </b>which are fine if you <b>just want</b> to stay for an <b>hour or two</b>, but if you <b>want to spend</b> the day there it’s better to park in <b>one of the four</b> underground <b><b>car park</b>s</b>. It’s not expensive and if you can present a receipt from one of the local stores, you’ll not be charged at all (Q14). After <b>six pm</b> many of the <b><b>car park</b>s</b> have a flat rate which varies but it is <b>usually very</b> reasonable.","————————-","The Sheepmarket is <b>one of the main</b> centres for art and history in the whole of the country. If you look at our map, you’ll see <b>some of the main</b> attractions there. <b>Most visitors</b> start from Crawley Road, at the bottom of the map. The Reynolds House is <b>one of the oldest</b> houses in the city, and is <b>open to the public</b>. It’s on the north side of Crawley Road, next to the foot<b>path that leads</b> to the <b>public gardens</b>. (Q15)","The area’s <b>particularly interesting</b> for its<b> unusual </b>sculptures. The Thumb’s is just what its name suggests, but it’s about 10 <b>metres high</b>. You’ll see it on <b>Hill Road</b>, <b>across the road</b> from the Bank. (Q16)","The Museum’s got a particularly <b>fine collection</b> of <b>New Zealand</b> landscapes. It’s on the <b>east side</b> of the Sheepmarket, on <b>City Road</b>. It’s on the <b>other <b>side of the road</b></b> from the <b>public gardens</b>, immediately facing the junction with <b>Hill Road</b>. (Q17)","The Contemporary <b>Art Gallery</b> is on a little road that leads off Station Square, not far from the <b>public gardens</b>. The road ends at the gallery – it doesn’t go anywhere else (Q18). That’s open <b>every day</b> except Mondays.","The Warner Gallery specialises in 19th-century art. It’s on <b>City Road</b>, near the junction with Crawley Road, on the <b>same <b>side of the road</b></b> as the <b>public gardens</b> (Q19). It’s open on weekdays from 9 to 5, and entry is free.","Finally, if you’re interested in purchasing <b>high quality</b> artwork, the place to go is Nucleus. You <b>need to go</b> from Crawley <b>Road up</b> through Station Square and east along <b>Hill Road</b> <b>until you get</b> to a small winding road turning off. Go up there and it’s on your right – if you get to <b>City Road</b> you’ve gone <b>too far</b>.

I could do with getting someone else’s opinion.","JOE:       Of course, Katie. What are you <b>going to talk</b> about?","KATIE:   It’s about <b>film adaptations</b> of Shakespeare’s plays. I’ve <b>got very</b> <b>interested in all</b> the <b>different approaches</b> that film directors take.","JOE:       Uhuh.","KATIE:   So I thought I’d start with Giannetti, who’s professor of film and literature, and in one of his books he <b>came up</b> with a<b> straightforward </b>classification of <b>film adaptations</b> based on how faithful they are to the original plays and novels. (Q21)","JOE:       Right.","KATIE:   I’ve already made <b>some notes</b> on that, so I <b>just need</b> to sort those out before the presentation. I thought that next I’d ask the class to <b>come up</b> with the worst examples of Shakespeare adaptations that they’ve seen, and to say why (Q22). That should be more fun than having their favourite versions.","JOE:       Yes, I can certainly think of a couple!","KATIE:   Right. Next I <b>want to talk</b> about Rachel Malchow. I <b>came across</b> something on the internet about her work on <b>film adaptations</b>, and I was thinking of <b>showing some</b> film<b> clips </b>to illustrate her ideas.","JOE:       Will you have <b>enough time</b>, though? Both to prepare and during the presentation? After all, I doubt if you’ll be <b>able to find</b> all the<b> clips </b>you want.","KATIE:   Hmm. Perhaps you’re right. OK, well, I’d better do <b>some slides</b> instead, saying how various films relate to what she says (Q23). That should encourage discussion.","JOE:       Mmm.","KATIE:   <b>Next I want</b> to <b>say something</b> about how plays may be chosen for adaptation because they’re concerned with issues of the time when the film is made. (Q24)","JOE:       You <b><b>mean things</b> like</b> patriotism, or the role of governments?","KATIE:   Exactly. It’s quite tricky, but I’ve got a <b>few ideas</b> I’d <b>like to discuss</b>.","———————–","KATIE:   And finally I <b>want to talk</b> about a few adaptations that I think illustrate a range of approaches, and <b>make some</b> comments on them. <b>Do you know</b> the Japanese film Ran?","JOE:       I haven’t seen it. It was based on Shakespeare’s King Lear, wasn’t it?","KATIE:   That’s right. It was a very loose adaptation, <b>using the same</b> situation and story, but moving it to 16th century Japan instead of 16th century Britain (Q25). So for example the king’s daughters become sons, because in Japanese culture at that time, women couldn’t succeed to the throne.","JOE:       OK. I hope you’re <b>going to talk</b> about the 1993 film of Much Ado About Nothing. I think that’s <b>one of the best</b> Shakespeare films. It really brings the play to life, doesn’t it?","KATIE:   Yes, I agree. And I think filming it in Italy, where the play is set, makes you see what life was like at the time of the play. (Q26)","JOE:       Absolutely. Right, what’s next?","KATIE:   Er, next, I thought Romeo & Juliet, the 1996 film, which moves the action into the <b>present day</b>. (Q27)","JOE:       Yes, it worked <b>really well</b>, I thought – changing the two<b> feuding </b>families in the original to two competing business empires, <b>even though</b> they’re speaking in the English of the original play.","KATIE:   You’d expect it would sound really bizarre, but I found I soon got used to it.","JOE:       <b>Me too</b>.","KATIE:   Then I thought I’d include a real Hollywood film, one that’s intended to<b> appeal </b>to a mass commercial audience.","JOE:       There must be <b>quite a number</b> of those.","KATIE:   Yes, but I’ve picked the 1996 film of Hamlet. It included every line of the text, but it’s more like a typical action hero movie (Q28) – there are loads of special effects, but no unifying<b> interpretation </b>of the play.","JOE:       All show and no substance.","KATIE:   Exactly. Then there’s Prospero’s Books, based on The Tempest. That was really innovative, from a<b> stylistic </b><b>point of view</b>. (Q29)","JOE:       Didn’t it include dance and singing and animation, as well as live actors?","KATIE:   Yes, it did. I <b>also <b>want to mention</b></b> Looking for Richard. Did you ever see it? (Q30)","JOE:       No, but I’ve read about it. It was a<b> blend </b>of a documentary with a few<b> scenes </b>from Richard III, wasn’t it?","KATIE:   That’s right. It’s more a way of looking into how people nowadays connect with the<b> playwright </b>– the play is <b>really just</b> the <b>starting point</b>. And that’ll be where I finish.","JOE:       Well, it <b>sounds as though</b> it’ll be <b>very interesting</b>.","#4 <b>Noise in cities</b> Transcript","The Part 4 <b>audio script</b> of <b>Noise in cities</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 8 is as follows:","This lecture will be about the science of acoustics, the study of sound, in relation to <b>urban environments</b> such as cities. As an acoustic engineer myself, I think this is an area where we’re likely to see great changes. In the past, researching urban<b> soundscapes </b>was simple. We measured levels of sound in decibels, so I used to take my sound meter and I measured the noise somewhere, and then I might ask a sample of people to say at what level the sound became annoying.","With data like this, acoustic engineers <b>have been able</b> to <b>build up</b> what we call noise maps, maps of the sound environment. But actually these aren’t a lot of use. What they do show is that the highest noise levels are generally on roads – well, that’s not really very surprising. But there’s <b>quite a lot</b> going on that these maps don’t show, because they can’t capture the complex <b>way that sound</b> varies over time.","So they ignore <b>important issues</b> such as the noise someone might hear from the open windows or gardens of their neighbours (Q31), and this sort of noise can be quite significant in summer. We don’t <b>have any</b> databases on this <b>sort of information</b>. As well as that, these records of sound levels <b>take no</b> account of the <b>fact that people</b> vary in their perceptions of noise – so <b>someone like</b> me with years of working in acoustics might be <b>very different</b> from you in that regard.","But anyway, <b>even though</b> these noise maps are fairly crude, they’ve been useful in providing information and raising awareness that noise matters, we <b>need to deal</b> with it and so it’s a political matter (Q32). And that’s important – we need rules and regulation because noise can cause <b>all sorts</b> of problems.","Those of you who are city-dwellers know that things go on 24 hours a day, so city-dwellers often suffer from interrupted sleep. It’s <b>also known</b> that noise can lead to a rise in levels of stress, due to <b>physical changes</b> in the body <b>affecting the composition</b> of the blood. And there are <b>other problems</b> as well, for instance if<b> schoolchildren </b>don’t have a quiet place to study, their work will suffer. (Q33)","Now, one problem with<b> decibel </b>measurement is that it doesn’t<b> differentiate </b>between <b>different types</b> of noise. <b>Some types</b> of sounds that <b>most people</b> would probably think of as nice and relaxing might well score quite highly in <b>decibel levels</b> – think of the sound made by a<b> fountain </b>in a town square, for example (Q34). That’s not necessarily something that we’d want to control or reduce. So maybe researchers should consider these sorts of sounds in <b>urban design</b>. This is going to be tricky because just measuring <b>decibel levels</b> isn’t going to help us here. Instead, <b>many researchers</b> are <b>using social</b> science techniques, studying people’s emotional response to sound by using questionnaires and so on. (Q35)","So what exactly <b>do <b>people want</b></b> to hear in an urban environment? <b>Some recent</b><b> interdisciplinary </b><b>research has</b> come out with results that at first sight seem<b> contradictory </b>– a city <b>needs to have</b> a sense of activity, so it needs to be lively, with <b>sounds like</b> the clack of <b>high heels</b> on a<b> pavement </b>or the hiss of a coffee machine, but these mustn’t be too intrusive, because at the <b>same time</b> we <b>need to be able</b> to relax. (Q36)","<b>One of the major</b> problems in achieving this will be getting <b><b>architects and town</b> planners</b> to use the research. Apart from studying the basics of acoustics, these people receive <b>very little</b> training in this area (Q37). But in fact they should be regarding sound as an opportunity to add to the experience of urban living, whereas at present they <b>tend to see</b> it as something to be avoided or reduced as far as possible, or something that’s just a job for engineers like the street<b> drainage </b>system.","What’s needed is for <b>noise in cities</b> to be regarded as an aesthetic quality, as <b>something that has</b> the qualities of an <b>art form</b>. If we acknowledge this, then we urgently <b>need to know</b> what governs it and how designers can work with it. We <b>need to develop</b> a complex <b>understanding of many</b> factors. What is the relationship between sound and culture? (Q38) What can we learn from<b> disciplines </b>such as<b> psychology </b>about the <b>way that sound</b> interacts with human development and<b> social </b>relationships, and the <b>way that sound</b> affects our thought and feelings? Can we learn anything from<b> physics </b>about the nature of sound itself? (Q39)","Today’s powerful technologies can <b>also help</b> us. To show us their ideas and help us to imagine the effect their buildings will have, <b><b>architects and town</b> planners</b> already use virtual reality – but these programs are silent (Q40). In the future such programs could use realistic sounds, meaning that<b> soundscapes </b>could be explored before being built. So hopefully, using the best technology we can lay our hands on, the city of the future will be a pleasure to the ears as well as the eyes."]},{"name":"GLS/13-1","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Cookery Classes Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of <b>Cookery Classes</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 1 is as follows:","OFFICIAL:            Hello, <b>Tourist Information</b> Centre, Mike speaking, how can I help you?","WOMAN:             Oh, hi.

My name’s Phil Sutton, and I’m chairman of the Highways Committee. We’ve called this meeting to inform <b>members of the public</b> about the <b>new regulations</b> for traffic and parking we’re proposing for Granford. I’ll start by<b> summarising </b>these changes before we open the meeting to questions.","So, why do we <b>need to make</b> these changes to traffic systems in Granford? Well, we’re very aware that traffic is <b>becoming an increasing</b> problem. It’s been especially noticeable with the increase in heavy traffic while they’ve been building the new hospital. But it’s the overall rise in the volume of traffic of <b>all kinds</b> that’s concerning us (Q11). To date there’s not been any increase in traffic accidents, but that’s not something we <b>want to see</b> happen, obviously.","We recently <b>carried out a survey</b> of <b>local residents</b>, and their responses were interesting. People were very concerned about the lack of visibility on some roads due to cars parked along the sides of the roads (Q12). We’d expected complaints about the congestion <b>near the school</b> when parents are dropping off their children or picking them up, but this wasn’t top of the list, and nor were noise and<b> fumes </b>from trucks and lorries, though they were mentioned by <b>some people</b>.","We think these new traffic regulations would make a lot of difference. But we <b>still have</b> a <b>long way</b> to go. We’ve <b>managed to keep</b> our proposals within budget, just, so they can be covered by the Council. But, of course, it’s <b>no good</b> introducing <b>new regulations</b> if we don’t have a <b>way of making</b> sure that everyone obeys them (Q13), and that’s an area we’re <b>still working</b> on with the help of<b> representatives </b>from the police force.","—————–","OK, so this slide shows a map of the <b>central area</b> of Granford, with the <b>High Street</b> in the middle and <b>School Road</b> on the right. Now, we <b>already have</b> a set of traffic lights in the <b>High Street</b> at the junction with Station Road, but we’re <b>planning to have</b> another set at the <b>other end</b>, at the <b>School Road</b> junction (Q14), to regulate the flow or traffic along the <b>High Street</b>.","We’re decided we definitely need a <b>pedestrian crossing</b>. We considered putting this on <b>School Road</b>, <b>just outside</b> the school, but in the <b>end we decided</b> that could lead to a lot of <b>traffic congestion</b> so we decided to locate it on the <b>High Street</b>, crossing the road in front of the supermarket (Q15). That’s a <b>very busy</b> area, so it should help things there.","We’re proposing some changes to parking. At present, parking isn’t allowed on the <b>High Street</b> outside the library, but we’re going to change that, and allow parking there (Q16), but not at the <b>other end</b> of the <b>High Street</b> near <b>School Road</b>.","There’ll be a new ‘No Parking’ sign on <b>School Road</b>, just by the entrance to the school (Q17),<b> forbidding </b>parking for 25 metres. This should improve visibility for drivers and pedestrians, especially on the <b>bend just</b> to the north of the school.","As far as disabled drivers are concerned, at present they have parking outside the supermarket, but<b> lorries </b><b>also use</b> those spaces, so we’ve <b>got two</b> new <b>disabled parking</b> spaces on the side <b>road up</b> towards the bank (Q18). It’s not ideal, but <b>probably better</b> than the present arrangement.","We also plan to widen the<b> pavement </b>on <b>School Road</b>. We think we can manage to get an extra half-metre on the <b>bend just</b> before you get to the school, on the <b>same <b>side of the road</b></b> (Q19).","Finally, we’ve introduced new restrictions on loading and unloading for the supermarket, so<b> lorries </b>will only be allowed to stop there before 8 am.

Were you thinking of <b>something to do</b> with seeds?","JACK:                    That’s right. I thought we could look at <b>seed germination</b> – how a seed begins to grow.","EMMA:                 OK. <b>Any particular</b> reason? I know you’re<b> hoping </b>to work in plant science eventually …","JACK:                    Yeah, but practically <b>everything we do</b> is going to feed into that. No, there’s an optional module on seed structure and function in the <b>third year</b> that I might do, so I thought it might be useful for that (Q21). If I choose that option, I don’t <b>have to do</b> a<b> dissertation </b>module.","EMMA:                 <b>Good idea</b>.","JACK:                    Well, I thought for this experiment we could look at the relationship between seed size and the way the seeds are planted. So, we could plant different sized seeds in <b>different ways</b>, and see which grow best.","EMMA:                 OK. We’d need to allow time for the seeds to <b>come up</b> (Q22).","JACK:                    That should be fine if we start now. A lot of the other possible experiments need <b>quite a bit</b> longer.","EMMA:                 So that’d make it a <b>good one</b> to choose. And I don’t suppose it’d need much equipment; we’re not doing chemical analysis or anything. Though that’s not really an issue, we’ve <b>got plenty</b> of equipment in the laboratory.","JACK:                    Yeah. We <b>need to have</b> a word with the tutor if we’re going to <b>go ahead</b> with it though. I’m sure our aim’s OK. It’s not very ambitious but the assignment’s only <b>ten percent</b> of our final mark, isn’t it? But we need to be sure we’re the <b><b>only one</b>s</b> doing it (Q23).","EMMA:                 Yeah, it’s <b>only five</b> percent actually, but it’d be a bit boring if everyone was doing it.","JACK:                    <b>Did you read</b> that book on <b>seed germination</b> on our <b>reading list</b>?","EMMA:                 The one by Graves? I looked through it for my last experiment, though it wasn’t all that<b> relevant </b>there. It would be for this experiment, though. I found it <b>quite hard</b> to follow – lots about the theory, which I hadn’t expected (Q24)","JACK:                    Yes, I’d been<b> hoping </b>for something more practical. It does include<b> references </b>to the recent findings on genetically-modified seeds, though.","EMMA:                 Yes, that was interesting.","JACK:                    I <b>read an article</b> about <b>seed germination</b> by Lee Hall.","EMMA:                 About seeds that lie in the ground for ages and only<b> germinate </b>after a fire?","JACK:                    That’s the one. I knew a bit about it already, but not about this research. His analysis of figures comparing the times of the fires and the proportion of seeds that<b> germinated </b>was done in a lot of detail – very<b> impressive </b>(Q25).","EMMA:                 Was that the article with the illustrations of early stages of <b>plant development</b>? They were <b>very clear</b>.","JACK:                    I think those diagrams were in <b>another article</b>.","———————–","EMMA:                 Anyway, shall we <b>have a look</b> at the procedure for our experiment? We’ll <b><b>need to get</b> going</b> with it quite soon.","JACK:                    Right. So the <b>first thing</b> we <b>have to do</b> is find our seeds. I think vegetable seeds would be best. And obviously they mustn’t all be the same size. So, how many sorts <b>do we need</b>? About four <b>different ones</b>? (Q26)","EMMA:                 I think that would be enough. There’ll be <b><b>quite a large</b> number</b> of seeds for <b>each one</b>.","JACK:                    Then, for <b>each seed</b> we <b>need to find</b> out how much it weighs (Q27), and also measure its dimensions, and we need to keep a careful record of all that.","EMMA:                 That’ll be quite time-consuming. And we <b>also <b>need to decide</b></b> how deep we’re going to plant the seeds (Q28) – right on the surface, a few millimetres down, or several centimetres.","JACK:                    OK. So then we get planting. <b>Do you think</b> we can plant several seeds together in the same plant pot? (Q29)","EMMA:                 No, I <b>think we need</b> a different <b>one for each</b> seed.","JACK:                    Right. And we’ll need to label them – we can use <b>different coloured</b> labels. Then we wait for the seeds to<b> germinate </b>– I reckon that’ll be about three weeks, depending on what the weather’s like. Then we see if our plants <b>have come</b> up, and <b>write down</b> how tall they’ve grown. (Q30)","EMMA:                 Then all we <b>have to do</b> is look at our numbers, and see if there’s any relation between them.","JACK:                    That’s right. So …","#4 <b>Effect of <b>urban <b>environments on animals</b></b></b> Transcript","The Part 4 <b>audio script</b> of <b>Effect of <b>urban <b>environments on animals</b></b></b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 1 is as follows:","Hi. Today we’re going to be looking at animals in <b>urban environments</b> and I’m going to be <b>telling you about some</b> research on how they’re affected by these environments.","Now, in evolutionary terms, <b>urban environments</b> represent huge upheavals, the sorts of massive changes that usually happen over <b>millions of years</b>. And we used to think that <b>only a few</b><b> species </b>could adapt to this new environment. <b>One species</b> which is <b>well known</b> as being <b>highly adaptable</b> is the crow, and there’ve been <b>various studies</b> about how they manage to learn <b>new skills</b> (Q31). Another successful<b> species </b>is the pigeon, because they’re able to<b> perch </b>on<b> ledges </b>on the walls of city buildings, <b>just like</b> they once<b> perched </b>on cliffs by the sea. (Q32).","But in fact, we’re now finding that these early immigrants were just the start of a more general <b>movement of animals</b> into cities, and of adaptation by these animals to <b>city life</b>. And <b>one thing</b> that researchers are finding especially interesting is the speed with which they’re doing this – we’re not talking about gradual evolution here – these animals are changing fast. (Q33)","<b>Let <b>me <b>tell you about some</b></b></b> of the studies that <b>have been carried</b> out in this area. So, in the University of Minnesota, a <b>biologist called</b> Emilie Snell-Rood and her <b>colleagues looked</b> at<b> specimens </b>of<b> urbanised </b><b>small mammals</b> such as<b> mice </b>and<b> gophers </b>that had been collected in Minnesota, and that are now kept in museums there.","And she found that during that time, these <b>small mammals</b> had experienced a jump in brain size when compared to rural mammals (Q34). Now, we can’t be sure this means they’re more intelligent, but since the sizes of <b>other parts</b> of the body didn’t change, it <b>does suggest</b> that something cognitive was going on. And Snell-Rood thinks that this change might reflect the cognitive demands of adjusting to <b>city life</b> – having to look in <b>different places</b> to find food, for example, and coping with a <b>whole new</b> set of dangers. (Q35)","Then over in Germany at the Max Planck Institute, there’s another <b>biologist called</b> Catarina Miranda who’s <b>done some</b> experiments with<b> blackbirds </b>living in <b>urban and rural</b> areas. And she’s been looking not at their anatomy but at their behaviour (Q36). So as you might expect, she’s found that the urban<b> blackbirds </b>tend to be quite bold – they’re prepared to face up to a lot of threats that would<b> frighten </b>away their country counterparts. But there’s <b>one type</b> of situation that <b>does seem</b> to<b> frighten </b>the urban blackbirds, and that’s anything new – anything they haven’t experienced before (Q37). And if you think about it, that’s quite<b> sensible </b>for a bird living in the city.","——————","Jonathan Atwell, in Indiana University, is <b>looking at how a range</b> of animals respond to <b>urban environments</b>. He’s found that when they’re under stress, their<b> endocrine </b>systems react by reducing the amount of<b> hormones </b>such as<b> corticosterone </b>into their blood (Q38). It’s a sensible-seeming adaptation. A rat that gets<b> scared </b><b>every time</b> a subway train rolls past won’t be <b>very successful</b>.","There’s <b>just one</b> more study I’d <b>like to mention</b> which is by Sarah Partan and her team, and they’ve been looking at how<b> squirrels </b>communicate in an urban environment, and they’ve found that a routine part of their communication is carried out by waving their tails (Q39). You do <b>also see</b> this in the country, but it’s much more<b> prevalent </b>in cities, <b>possibly because</b> it’s effective in a noisy environment.","So what are the long-term implications of this? <b>One possibility</b> is that we may see <b><b>completely new</b> species</b> developing in cities. But on the other hand, it’s possible that not all of these adaptations will be permanent (Q40).","So, now we’ve <b>had a look</b>…"]},{"name":"GLS/13-2","paragraph":["<h2>#1 South City Cycling Club Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of <b><b>South <b>City Cycling</b></b> Club</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 2 is as follows:","JIM:                      Hello, <b><b>South <b>City Cycling</b></b> Club</b>.","WOMAN:             Oh, hi.

Well there are basically <b>two types</b> of adult membership. If you’re pretty serious about cycling, there’s the <b>Full membership</b>. That costs 260 dollars and that covers you not just for ordinary cycling but also for races both <b>here in the city</b> and <b>also in other</b> parts of Australia. (Q1)","WOMAN:             Right. Well, I’m not <b>really up</b> to that standard. I was more interested in just joining a group to <b>do some</b> cycling in my <b>free time</b>.","JIM:                      Sure. That’s why <b>most people</b> join. So, in that case you’d be better with the Recreational membership. That’s 108 dollars if you’re over 19, and 95 dollars if you’re under.","WOMAN:             I’m 25.","JIM:                      OK. It’s paid quarterly, and you can upgrade it later to the <b>Full membership</b> if you want to, of course. Now both <b>types of membership</b> include the club fee of 20 dollars. They <b>also provide</b> insurance in case you <b>have an accident</b> (Q2), though we hope you won’t need that, of course.","WOMAN:             No. OK, well, I’ll go with the Recreational membership, I think. And that allows me to join in the club activities, and so on?","JIM:                      That’s right. And once you’re a member of the club, you’re also<b> permitted </b>to wear our kit when you’re out cycling. It’s green and white.","WOMAN:             Yes, I’ve seen cyclists wearing it. So, can I buy that at the club?","JIM:                      No, it’s made to order by a company in Brisbane. You can find them online: they’re called Jerriz (Q3). That’s J-E-R-R-I-Z. You can use your membership number to <b>put in an order</b> on their website.","WOMAN:             OK. Now, can you <b>tell <b>me a bit</b></b> about the rides I can do?","JIM:                      Sure. So we <b>have training</b> rides <b>pretty well</b> every morning, and they’re a <b><b>really good</b> way</b> of improving your <b>cycling skills</b> as well as your <b>general level</b> of fitness, but they’re <b>different levels</b>. Level A is <b>pretty fast</b> – you’re looking at about 30 or 35 kilometres an hour. If you can do about 25 kilometres an hour, you’d probably be <b>level B</b> (Q4), and then level C are the novices, who stay at about 15 <b><b>kilometres per</b> hour</b>.","WOMAN:             Right. Well I reckon I’d be <b>level B</b>. So, when are the sessions for that level?","JIM:                      There are a couple <b>each week</b>. They’re both <b>early morning</b> sessions. There’s one on Tuesdays, and for that one you meet at 5.30 am, and the meeting point’s the<b> stadium </b>(Q5) – <b>do you know</b> where that is?","WOMAN:             Yes, it’s <b>quite near</b> my home, in fact. OK, and how about the <b>other one</b>?","JIM:                      That’s on Thursdays. It starts at the <b>same time</b>, but they meet at the main gate to the park.

So, if you have a job it’s easy to fit in before you go to work. And the <b>members often</b> <b>go somewhere</b> for coffee afterwards (Q7), so it’s quite a<b> social </b>event.","WOMAN:             OK. That <b>sounds good</b>. I’ve <b>only just</b> moved to the city so I don’t actually know <b>many people</b> yet.","JIM:                      Well, it’s a great way to meet people.","WOMAN:             And does <b>each ride</b> have a leader? (Q8)","JIM:                      Sometimes, but not always. But you don’t <b>really need</b> one; the group members on the ride support <b>one another</b>, anyway.","WOMAN:             How would we know where to go?","JIM:                      If you check the club website, you’ll see that the route for <b>each ride</b> is clearly marked. So you can just print that out (Q9) and take it along with you. It’s similar from one week to another, but it’s not always <b>exactly the same</b>.","WOMAN:             And what do I <b>need to bring</b>?","JIM:                      Well, bring a bottle of water, and your phone.

OK, so this meeting is for <b>new staff</b> and staff who haven’t been involved with our <b>volunteering projects</b> yet. So basically, the idea is that we allow staff to <b>give up</b> some of their work <b>time to help</b> on various charity projects to benefit the <b>local community</b>. We’ve been doing this for the last <b>five years</b> and it’s been <b>very successful</b>.","Participating doesn’t necessarily involve a huge time commitment. The <b>company will pay</b> for <b>eight hours</b> of your time. That can be used over <b><b>one or two</b> days</b> all at once, or spread over several months <b>throughout the year</b> (Q11). T<b>here are some</b> staff who enjoy volunteering so much they <b>also give</b> <b>up their own</b> <b>free time</b> for a <b>couple of hours</b> every week. It’s completely up to you. Obviously, <b>many people</b> will have family commitments and aren’t as available as <b>other <b>members of staff</b></b>.","Feedback from staff has been<b> overwhelmingly </b>positive. Because they felt they were <b><b>doing some</b>thing</b> <b>really useful</b>, <b>nearly everyone</b> agreed that volunteering made them feel more motivated at work (Q12). They <b>also like</b>d building relationships with the people in the <b>local community</b> and felt valued by them. <b><b>One or two</b> people</b> <b>also said</b> it was a <b>good thing</b> to have on their CVs.","<b><b>One part</b>icular</b>ly <b>successful project</b> <b>last year</b> was the Get Working Project. This was aimed at helping unemployed <b>people in the area</b> <b>get back</b> to work. Our staff were <b>able to help</b> them improve their telephone skills, such as <b>writing down</b> messages and speaking with confidence to <b>potential customers</b>, which they <b>had found</b> <b>quite difficult</b> (Q13). This is something <b>many employers</b> look for in job applicants – and something we all do without even thinking about, <b>every day</b> at work.","We’ve got an <b>exciting new</b> project starting this year. <b>Up until</b> now, we’re mainly focused on projects to do with education and training. And we’ll continue with out reading project in schools and our work with local charities. But we’re also agreed to help out on a conservation project in Redfern Park (Q14). So if any of you fancy being outside and getting your hands dirty, this is the project for you.","<b>I </b> <b>also <b>want to mention</b></b> the annual <b>Digital Inclusion</b> Day, which is <b>coming up</b> <b>next month</b>. The aim of this is to help <b>older people</b> keep <b>up with technology</b>. And this year, instead of hosting the event in our own training facility, we’re using the ICT suite at Hill College (Q15), as it can hold <b>far more people</b>.","We’ve invited over 60 people from the Silver Age <b>Community Centre</b> to <b>take part</b>, so we’ll <b>need a lot</b> of volunteers to help with this event.","If you’re interested in <b>taking part</b>, please go to the volunteering section of our website and complete the<b> relevant </b>form (Q16). We won’t be <b>providing any</b> training for this but you’ll be paired with an experienced volunteer if you’ve never done it before. By the way, don’t <b>forget to tell</b> your manager about any volunteering activities you decide to do.","——————","The participants on the <b>Digital Inclusion</b> Day <b>really benefit</b>ed. The majority were in their seventies, though some where younger and a few were even in their nineties! <b>Quite a few</b> owned both a computer and a mobile phone, but these tended to be outdated model (Q17). They generally knew how to do simple things, like send texts, but weren’t aware of recent developments in mobile phone technology. A few were <b>keen to learn</b> but most were quite<b> dismissive </b>at first – they couldn’t see the point of updating their skills (Q18). But that soon changed.","The feedback was <b>very positive</b>. The really encouraging thing was that participants all <b>said they felt</b> much more confident about using <b>social media</b> to keep in touch with their grandchildren (Q19), who prefer this <b>form of communication</b> to phoning or sending emails. A lot of them <b>also said</b> playing online games would help them make <b>new friends</b> and keep their brains active (Q20).

And I’m really struggling. Should I assume the <b>other students</b> don’t <b>know much</b>, and give them a kind of general introduction, or should I try and make them share my fascination with a <b>particular aspect</b>? (Q21)","TUTOR:                You could do either, but you’ll <b>need to have</b> it clear in your own mind.","RUSS:                   Then I think I’ll give an overview.","TUTOR:                OK. Now, <b>one way</b> of approaching this is to work through developments in <b>chronological order</b>.","RUSS:                   Uh-huh.","TUTOR:                On the other hand, you could talk about the<b> numerous </b>ways that<b> nanotechnology </b>is being applied.","RUSS:                   You <b><b>mean things</b> like</b> thin films on camera displays to make them water-repellent, and additives to make motorcycle helmets stronger and lighter.","TUTOR:                Exactly. Or <b>another way</b> would be to focus on its impact in one <b>particular area</b> (Q22), say medicine, or space exploration.","RUSS:                   That would <b>make it easier</b> to focus. Perhaps I should do that.","TUTOR:                I think that would be a <b>good idea</b>.","RUSS:                   Right. How important is it to include slides in the presentation?","TUTOR:                They aren’t essential, by any means. And there’s a danger of tailoring what you say to fit whatever slides you can find. While it can be good to includes slides, you could end <b>up spending</b> <b>too long</b> <b>looking for suitable</b> ones. You might find it better to leave them out. (Q23)","RUSS:                   I see. <b>Another thing</b> I was wondering about was how to start. I know presentations often begin with ‘First I’m <b>going to talk</b> about this, and then I’ll talk about that’, but I thought about asking the audience what they know about nanotechnology.","TUTOR:                That would be fine if you had an <b>hour or two</b> for the presentation, but you might find that you can’t <b><b>do any</b>thing</b> with the answers you get, and it simply eats into the <b>short time</b> that’s available.","RUSS:                   So, maybe I should mention a particular way that<b> nanotechnology </b>is used, to focus people’s attention. (Q24)","TUTOR:                That <b>sounds sensible</b>.","RUSS:                   What <b>do you think</b> I should <b>do next</b>? I really <b>have to plan</b> the presentation today and tomorrow.","TUTOR:                Well, initially I think you should ignore all the notes you’ve made, take a small piece of paper, and write a single short sentence that ties together the whole presentation (Q25): it can be <b>something as simple</b> as ‘Nanotechnology is already improving our lives’. Then <b>start planning</b> the content around that. You can always modify that sentence later, if you need to.","RUSS:                   OK.","————————————","TUTOR:                OK, <b>now let</b>’s think about actually giving the presentation.","RUSS:                   That’s right. It was pretty rubbish!","TUTOR:                Let’s say it was <b>better in some</b> respects than in others. With regard to the structure.

(Q28)","RUSS:                   <b>Oh dear</b>. What <b>did you think</b> of the language? I knew that not everyone was familiar with the subject, so I tried to make it as simple as I could.","TUTOR:                Yes, that <b>came across</b>. You used a <b>few words</b> that are specific to the field, but you always explained what they meant, so the audience wouldn’t <b>have had</b> any <b>difficulty understanding</b>.

They allow us to <b><b>mentally travel</b> back</b> in time to an event from the past. These include various details about these events, for example, when an event happened and <b>other information</b> such as the location (Q31). To help understand this concept, try to remember the <b>last time</b> you ate dinner at a restaurant. The ability to remember where you ate, who you were with and the items you ordered are all features of an <b>episodic memory</b>.","<b>Episodic memory</b> is distinct from <b>another type</b> of memory called <b>semantic memory</b>. This is the type of<b> factual </b>memory that we have in common with everyone else – that is your <b>general knowledge</b> of the world (Q32). To <b>build up</b>on a previous example, remembering where you <b>parked your car</b> is an example of <b>episodic memory</b>, but your understanding of what a car is and how an engine works are examples of<b> sematic </b>memory. Unlike <b>episodic memory</b>, <b>semantic memory</b> isn’t dependent on recalling personal experiences. (Q33)","<b>Episodic memory</b> can be thought of as a process with <b>several different</b> steps of memory processing: encoding,<b> consolidation </b>and retrieval.","The initial step is called encoding. This involves the process of receiving and registering information, which is necessary for creating memories of information or events that you experience. The degree to which you can successfully encode information depends on the level of attention you give to an event while it’s actually happening (Q34). Being distracted can make effective encoding <b>very difficult</b>. Encoding of <b>episodic memories</b> is also influenced by how you process the event. For example, if you were introduced to someone called Charlie, you might make the connection that your uncle has the <b>same name</b>. Future<b> recollection </b>of Charlie’s name is <b>much easier</b> if you have a strategy to help you encode it. (Q35)","Memory consolidation, the next <b>step in forming</b> an <b>episodic memory</b>, is the process by which memories of <b>encoded information</b> are strengthened,<b> stabilised </b>and stored to<b> facilitate </b><b>later retrieval</b>.<b> Consolidation </b>is <b>most effective</b> when the information being stored can be linked to an existing network of information (Q36).<b> Consolidation </b>makes it possible for you to store memories for <b>later retrieval</b> indefinitely. Forming strong memories depends on the frequency with which you try to retrieve them (Q37).","The last <b>step in forming</b> <b>episodic memories</b> is called retrieval, which is the conscious<b> recollection </b>of <b>encoded information</b>. Retrieving information from <b>episodic memory</b> depends upon semantic, olfactory,<b> auditory </b>and visual factors. These help <b>episodic memory</b><b> retrieval </b>by acting as a prompt. For example, when recalling where you <b>parked your car</b> you may use the colour of a sign close to where you parked (Q38). You <b>actually have</b> to <b><b>mentally travel</b> back</b> to the moment you parked.","——————","There are a <b>wide range</b> of<b> neurological </b>diseases and conditions that can affect <b>episodic memory</b>. These range from Alzheimer’s to<b> schizophrenia </b>to autism. An<b> impairment </b>of <b>episodic memory</b> can have a profound effect on individuals’ lives. For example, the<b> symptoms </b>of<b> schizophrenia </b>can be reasonably well controlled by medication; however, patients’ <b>episodic memory</b> may still be<b> impaired </b>and so they are often unable to return to university or work. Recent <b><b>studies have</b> shown</b> that computer- assisted games designed to keep the brain active can <b>help improve</b> their <b>episodic memory</b>. (Q39)","<b>Episodic memories</b> can <b>help people</b> connect with others, for instance by sharing<b> intimate </b>details about their past; something individuals with<b> autism </b>often <b>have problems</b> with. This may be caused by an absence of a sense of self (Q40). This is essential for the storage of <b>episodic memory</b>, and <b>has been found</b> to be<b> impaired </b>in children with autism. <b><b>Research has</b> shown</b> that treatments that improve memory may <b>also have</b> a <b>positive impact</b> on children’s<b> social </b>development.","<b>One study</b> looked at a …"]},{"name":"GLS/13-3","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Moving to Branford City Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of <b><b>Moving to Branford</b> City</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 3 is as follows:","LINDA:  Hello, Linda speaking.","MATT:   Oh hi, Linda.

How can I help?","MATT:   Well, <b>first of all</b> – which area to live in?","LINDA:  Well, I live in Dalton (Example), which is a <b>really nice</b><b> suburb </b>– not <b>too expensive</b>, and there’s a nice park.","MATT:   <b>Sounds good</b>. Do you <b>know how much</b> it would be to rent a two bedroom flat there?","LINDA:  Yeah, you should be able to <b><b>get some</b>thing</b> reasonable for 850 (Q1) pounds per month. That’s what people typically pay. You certainly wouldn’t want to pay more than 900 pounds. That doesn’t include bills or anything.","MATT:   No. That sound alright. I’ll definitely <b>have a look</b> there. Are the <b>transport links</b> easy from where you live?","LINDA:  Well, I’m very lucky.

Is it safe to cycle around the city?","LINDA:  Yes, it’s fine. And it keeps me fit. Anyway, driving to <b><b>work in the city</b> centre</b> would be a nightmare because there’s hardly <b>any parking</b> (Q3). And the traffic during the rush hour can be bad.","MATT:   I’d be working from home but I’d <b>have to go</b> to London <b><b>one or two</b> days</b> a week.","LINDA:  Oh, that’s perfect.

The first question to <b>ask yourself</b> is whether you would enjoy training in a gym. <b>Many people</b> are put off by the <b>idea of having</b> to fit a visit to the gym into their <b>busy day</b>. You often <b>have to go</b> <b>very early</b> or late as some gyms can <b>get very</b> crowded but with regular training you’ll see a <b>big difference</b> in a <b>relatively short</b> space of time. (Q11)","Running <b>has become</b> incredibly <b>popular in recent</b> years. That’s <b>probably got</b> a <b>lot to do</b> with the fact that it’s a very accessible form of exercise that anyone can run even if you could only run a few meters to begin with (Q12). But <b>make <b>sure you get</b></b> the right shoes. It’s worth investing in a <b>high quality</b> pair and they don’t come cheap. Another great thing about running is that you can do it at <b>any time</b> of day or night. The <b>only thing</b> that may stop you is snow and ice.","Swimming is another <b><b>really good</b> way</b> to build fitness. What attracts <b>many people</b> is that you can swim in an indoor pool at any <b>time of year</b> (Q13). On the other hand, it can be quite boring or solitary. It’s hard to chat to people while you’re swimming lengths.","Cycling <b>has become</b> almost as popular as running in <b>recent years</b>. That’s <b>probably because</b> as well as <b>improving their fitness</b> <b>many people</b> say being out in the <b>fresh air</b> in a park or in the countryside can be fun (Q14), provided the conditions are right of course. Only<b> fanatics </b>go out in the wind and rain.","Yoga is a <b>good choice</b> for those of you looking for exercise, which focuses on developing both a healthy <b>mind and body</b>. It’s a <b>good way</b> of building strength and with the right instructor there’s less chance of hurting yourself than with other more active sports. But don’t <b>expect to find</b> it easy. It can be surprisingly challenging, especially for people who aren’t very flexible. Getting a <b>personal trainer</b> is a <b>good way</b> to start your fitness program. Obviously there can be significant costs involved. But if you’ve <b>got some</b>one there to encourage you and <b>help you achieve</b> your goals, you’re <b>less likely</b> to <b>give up</b>. <b>Make <b>sure you get</b></b> someone with a recognised qualification though. Or you could do yourself <b>permanent damage</b>. (Q15&Q16)","—————–","Whatever you do, don’t join a gym and you’re sure you’ll make good use of it. So <b>many people</b> waste lots of money by signing up for membership and then <b>hardly ever</b> go. What happens to their good intentions? I don’t <b>think people</b> suddenly stop caring about <b>improving their fitness</b> or decide they have more <b>important thing</b>s to do. I <b>think people</b> lose interest when they don’t think they’re making enough progress. That’s when they <b>give up</b> hope and stop believing they’ll ever achieve their goals. Also, what people sometimes don’t realize when they start is that it <b>takes a lot</b> of determination and <b>hard work</b> to keep training week after week, and <b>lots of people</b> don’t have that kind of commitment (Q17&Q18). <b>One thing</b> you can <b>do to help</b> yourself is to set<b> manageable </b>goals (Q19), be realistic and don’t push yourself <b>too far</b>. <b>Some people</b> advise writing goes down but I think it’s better to have a flexible approach. <b>Give yourself</b> a <b>really nice</b> treat <b>every time</b> you r<b>each one</b> of your goals (Q20) and don’t <b>get too</b> upset if you experience setbacks. It’s a journey. There are bound to be difficulties along the way.","#3 <b>Using <b>natural <b>dyes to <b>colour fabrics</b></b></b></b> Transcript","The Part 3 <b>audio transcript</b> of <b>Using <b>natural <b>dyes to <b>colour fabrics</b></b></b></b> in Cambridge 13 <b>Listening Test</b> 3 is as follows:","TUTOR:                OK, Jim. You <b>wanted to see</b> me about your<b> textile </b>design project.","JIM:                      That’s right. I’ve been <b>looking at how a range</b> of <b>natural dyes</b> can be used to <b>colour fabrics</b> like <b>cotton and wool</b>.","TUTOR:                Why <b>did you choose</b> that topic?","JIM:                      Well, I <b>got a lot</b> of useful ideas from the museum, you know, at that exhibition of textiles. But I’ve <b>always been interested</b> in anything to do with colour. <b>Years ago</b>, I went to a<b> carpet </b>shop with my parents when we were on holiday in Turkey, and I remember all the amazing colours. (Q21)","TUTOR:                They might not <b>all have</b> been <b>natural dyes</b>.","JIM:                      Maybe not, but for the project I decided to follow it up. And I found a great book about a botanic garden in California that specialises in <b>plants used</b> for dyes.","TUTOR:                OK. So, in your project, you had to include a practical investigation.","JIM:                      Yeah. At first I couldn’t decide on my variables. I was going to <b>just look</b> at <b>one type</b> of<b> fibre </b>for example, <b>like cotton</b> …","TUTOR:                … and see how <b>different types</b> of dyes affected it?","JIM:                      Yes. Then I decided to include others as well, so I looked at <b>cotton and wool</b> and nylon. (Q22)","TUTOR:                With <b>just one</b> type of dye?","JIM:                      Various types, including some that weren’t natural, for comparison.","TUTOR:                OK.","JIM:                      So, I did the experiments <b>last week</b>. I used some ready-made <b>natural dyes</b>. I found a website which supplied them, they came in <b>just a few</b> days, but I <b>also made</b> some of my own.","TUTOR:                That must <b>have taken</b> <b>quite a bit</b> of time.","JIM:                      Yes, I’d thought it’d just be a matter of a<b> teaspoon </b>or so of dye, and actually that wasn’t the case at all. Like I was using one vegetable, beetroot, for a red dye, and I had to <b>chop up</b> a whole pile of it (Q23). So it <b>all too</b>k longer than I’d expected.","TUTOR:                <b>One possibility</b> is to use food colourings.","JIM:                      I did use one. That was a yellow dye, an artificial one.","TUTOR:                Tartrazine?","JIM:                      Yeah. I used it on cotton first. It came out a great colour, but when I<b> rinsed </b>the material, the colour just <b>washed away</b> (Q24). I’d been going to try it out on nylon, but I abandoned that idea.","TUTOR:                Were you worried about <b>health issues</b>?","JIM:                      I’d thought if it’s a legal food colouring, it must be safe.","TUTOR:                Well, it can occasionally cause allergic reactions, I believe.","———————–","TUTOR:                So what <b>natural dyes</b> did you look at?","JIM:                      Well, one was turmeric. The colour’s great, it’s a really strong yellow. It’s generally used in dishes like curry.","TUTOR:                It’s meant to be <b>quite good</b> for your health when eaten, but you might find it’s not permanent when it’s <b>used as a dye</b> – a few washes, and it’s gone. (Q25)","JIM:                      Right. I used<b> beetroot </b>as a<b> dye </b>for wool. When I <b>chop up</b><b> beetroot </b>to eat I always <b>end up</b> with bright red hands, but the<b> wool </b><b>ended up</b> just a sort of<b> watery </b>cream shade (Q26). Disappointing.","TUTOR:                There’s a natural<b> dye </b>called Tyrian purple. Have you heard of that?","JIM:                      Yes. It comes from a shellfish, and it was worn in <b>ancient times</b> but only by important people as it was so rare. I didn’t use it. (Q27)","TUTOR:                It <b>fell out of use</b> centuries ago, though one researcher <b>managed to get</b> hold of <b>some recent</b>ly. But that shade of purple can be produced by chemical dyes nowadays. Did you <b>use any</b> black dyes?","JIM:                      Logwood. That was quite complicated. I had to prepare the fabric so the<b> dye </b>would take.","TUTOR:                I hope you were careful to wear gloves.","JIM:                      Yes. I know the danger with that dye.","TUTOR:                Good. It can be extremely dangerous if it’s<b> ingested </b>(Q28). Now,<b> presumably </b>you <b>had a look</b> at an insect-based dye? Like cochineal, for example?","JIM:                      Yes. I didn’t <b>actually make</b> that, I didn’t have <b>time to start</b><b> crushing </b>up insects to get the red colour and anyway they’re not available here, but I <b>managed to get</b> the<b> dye </b>quite easily from a website. But it cost a fortune (Q29). I can see why it’s generally just used in cooking, and in <b>small quantities</b>.","TUTOR:                Yes, it’s very effective, but that’s precisely why it’s not <b>used as a dye</b>.","JIM:                      I <b>also read</b> about using metal oxide. Apparently you can allow iron to<b> rust </b>while it’s in contact with the fabric, and that colours it.","TUTOR:                Yes, that <b>works well</b> for<b> dying </b>cotton. But you have to be careful as the metal can actually affect the fabric (Q30) and so you can’t expect to get a lot of wear out of fabrics treated in this way. And the colours are quite subtle, not everyone likes them. Anyway, it looks as if you’ve done a lot of work …","#4 The <b>Sleepy Lizard</b> Transcript","The Part 4 <b>audio script</b> of The <b>Sleepy Lizard</b> (Tiliqua Rugosa) in <b>Listening Test</b> 3 is as follows:","<b>Last week</b>, we <b>started looking</b> at reptiles, including<b> crocodiles </b>and snakes. Today, I’d like us to <b>have a look</b> at another<b> reptile </b>– the<b> lizard </b>– and in particular, at some <b>studies that have</b> been done on a <b>particular type</b> of<b> lizard </b>whose Latin name is<b> tiliqua </b>rugosa. This is <b>commonly known</b> as the <b>sleepy lizard</b>, because it’s quite slow in its movements and spends <b>quite a lot</b> of its time dozing under rocks or <b>lying in the sun</b>.","I’ll start with a general description. <b><b>Sleepy lizard</b>s</b> live in Western and South Australia, where they’re quite common. Unlike European lizards, which are mostly small, green and fast-moving, <b><b>sleepy lizard</b>s</b> are brown, but what’s particularly distinctive about them is the colour of their tongue, which is dark blue (Q31), in contrast with the lining of their mouth which is bright pink. And they’re <b>much bigger</b> than most European lizards. They <b>have quite</b> a varied diet, including insects and even small animals, but they mostly eat plants of varying kinds. (Q32)","<b>Even though</b> they’re quite large and powerful, with strong<b> jaws </b>that can<b> crush </b>beetles and snail shells, they still <b>have quite</b> a <b>few predators</b>. Large <b>birds like</b><b> cassowaries </b>were <b>one of the main</b> ones in the past, but nowadays they’re more likely to be caught and killed by snakes (Q33). Actually, another <b>threat to their survival</b> isn’t a predator at all, but is man-made – <b><b>quite a large</b> number</b> of <b><b>sleepy lizard</b>s</b> are killed by cars when they’re trying to cross highways.","One <b>study carried</b> out by Michael Freake at Flinders University investigated the methods of navigation of these lizards. Though they move slowly, they can travel quite <b>long distances</b>. And he <b>found that even</b> if they were taken <b>some distance</b> away from their home territory, they could usually <b>find their way</b> <b>back home</b> as long as they could see the sky – they didn’t need <b>any other</b> landmarks on the ground. (Q34)","———————","Observations of these <b>lizards in the wild</b> <b>have also</b> revealed that their<b> mating </b>habits are quite unusual. Unlike most animals, it seems that they’re relatively monogamous, returning to the same partner year after year (Q35). And the male and female also stay together for a <b>long time</b>, <b>both before and after the birth</b> of their young.","It’s <b>quite interesting</b> to think about the <b>possible reason</b>s for this. It could be that it’s to do with protecting their young – you’d expect them to have a <b>much better</b> chance of survival if they <b>have both</b> parents around. But in fact observers <b>have no</b>ted that once the babies have<b> hatched </b>out of their eggs, they <b>have hardly</b> any contact with their parents (Q36). So, there’s not really any <b>evidence to support</b> that idea.","Another suggestion’s based on the observation that <b>male lizards</b> in<b> monogamous </b>relationships tend to be bigger and stronger than <b>other males</b>. So maybe the <b>male lizards</b> stay around so they can give the fe<b>male lizards</b> protection from <b>other males</b> (Q37). But again, we’re not really sure.","Finally, I’d <b>like to mention</b> <b>another study</b> that involved collecting data by tracking the lizards. I was actually involved in this myself. So we caught some <b>lizards in the wild</b> and we developed a tiny GPS system that would allow us to track them, and we fixed this onto their tails (Q38). Then we set the<b> lizards </b>free again, and we were <b>able to track</b> them for <b>twelve days</b> and gather data, not just about their location, but even about how many steps they took during this period. (Q39)","One surprising thing we discovered from this is that there were <b>far fewer</b> meetings between<b> lizards </b>than we expected – it seems that they were actually <b>trying to avoid</b> <b>one another</b>. So why would that be? Well, again we have <b>no clear</b> evidence, but one<b> hypothesis </b>is that <b>male lizards</b> can cause quite serious injuries to <b>one another</b>, so maybe this avoidance is a way of preventing this (Q40) – of self-preservation, if you like. But we need to collect a lot more data before we can be sure of any of this."]},{"name":"GLS/13-4","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Alex’s Training Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of Alex’s Training in <b>Listening Test</b> 4 is as follows:","MARTHA:             Hi Alex.

Everyone says by the <b>end of the year</b> you gain so much confidence.","ALEX:                    You’re right. That’s the <b>most useful</b> part about it. There’s a <b>lot of variety</b> too. You’re given lots of <b><b>different things</b> to do</b>. I enjoyed it all – I didn’t even mind the studying.","MARTHA:             <b>Do you have</b> to spend <b>any time</b> in college?","ALEX:                    Yes, <b>one day</b> <b>each month</b> (Q6). So you get lots of support from both your tutor and your manager.","MARTHA:             That’s good. And the company is <b>easy to get</b> to, isn’t it?","ALEX:                    Yes, it’s <b>very close</b> to the train station so the location’s a real advantage.

My name’s Annie. I hope you enjoyed the bus trip from the airport – we’ve certainly <b>got plenty</b> of snow today! Well, you’ve come to <b>New Zealand</b>’s<b> premier </b>snow and<b> ski </b>centre, and we’ve a whole load of activities for you during your week here.","<b>Most visitors</b> <b>come here</b> for the cross-country skiing, where you’re on fairly flat ground for <b>most of the time</b>, rather than <b>going down</b><b> steep </b>mountainsides. There are marked trails, but you can also leave these and go off on your own and that’s an experience not to be missed (Q11). You can go at your own speed – it’s great <b>aerobic exercise</b> if you really push yourself, or if you prefer you can just glide gently along and enjoy the beautiful scenery.","This afternoon, you’ll be going on a dog-sled trip. You may <b>have seen</b> our dogs on TV recently racing in the winter<b> sled </b>festival. If you want, you can <b>have your own</b> team for the afternoon and learn how to drive them (Q12), following behind our leader on the trail. Or if you’d prefer, you can <b><b>just sit</b> back</b> in the<b> sled </b>and enjoy the ride as a passenger.","At the weekend, we have the team relay event, and you’re all <b>welcome to join</b> in. We <b>have a local</b> school coming along, and a lot of the teachers are <b>taking part</b> too. Participation rather than winning is the main focus, and there’s a medal for everyone who <b>takes part</b> (Q13). Participants are in teams of two to four, and <b>each team</b> must complete four laps of the course.","For your final expedition, you’ll head off to <b>Mount Frenner</b> wearing a pair of special snow shoes which allow you to walk on top of the snow. This is an area where miners once searched for gold, though there are <b>very few</b> traces of their work left now. When the snow melts in summer, the mountain<b> slopes </b>are<b> carpeted </b>in flowers and plants. It’s a long ascent, though not too steep, and walkers generally take a <b>couple of days</b> to get to the summit (Q14) and return.","You’ll spend the night in our<b> hut </b>half-<b>way up</b> the mountain. That’s included in your package for the stay. It’s got cooking facilities, firewood and water for drinking (Q15). For washing, we recommend you use melted snow, though, to<b> conserve </b>supplies. We can take your luggage up on our snowmobile for you for just ten dollars a person. The<b> hut </b>has cooking<b> facilities </b>so you can make a hot meal in the evening and morning, but you <b>need to take</b> your own food.","The weather on <b>Mount Frenner</b> can be very stormy. In that case, stay in the<b> hut </b>– generally the storms don’t <b>last long</b> (Q16). Don’t stress about getting <b>back here</b> to the centre in time to catch the airport bus – they’ll probably not be running anyway. We <b>do have</b> an<b> emergency </b>locator<b> beacon </b>in the<b> hut </b>but <b>only use</b> that if it’s real emergency, like if someone’s ill or injured.","—————–","Now, <b>let me</b> <b>tell you something</b> about the different ski<b> trails </b>you can follow during your stay here.","Highland Trail’s directly accessible from where we are now. This trail’s been designed to give first-timers an experience they’ll enjoy regardless of their age or skill, but it’s also ideal for experts to practise their technique (Q17).","Then there’s Pine<b> Trail </b>… if you’re nervous about skiing, leave this one to the experts! You follow a<b> steep </b>valley looking <b>right down</b> on the river below – scary! But if you’ve fully mastered the techniques needed for hills, it’s great fun (Q18).","Stony Trail’s a <b>good choice</b> once you’ve got a general idea of the basics. There are <b>one or two</b> tricky sections, but <b>nothing too</b> challenging. There’s a shelter half-way where you can sit and take a break and enjoy the afternoon sunshine. (Q19)","And finally, Loser’s Trail. This starts off following a<b> gentle </b>river valley but the last part is quite exposed so the snow conditions can be challenging – if it’s snowing or windy, check with us before you set out to <b>make sure</b> the trail’s open that day. (Q20)","Right, so now if you’d like to follow me, we’ll <b>get started</b> …","#3 <b>Food packaging</b> labels Transcript","The Part 3 <b>audio transcript</b> of Labels showing information on nutrition in <b>food packaging</b> in Cambridge 13 <b>Listening Test</b> 4 is as follows:","JACK:     I’ve <b>still got</b> loads to do for our report on <b>nutritional food</b> labels.","ALICE:   <b>Me too</b>. What did you learn from doing the project about your own shopping habits?","JACK:     Well, I’ve always <b>had to check</b> labels for traces of<b> peanuts </b>in everything I eat because of my allergy. But beyond that I’ve never really been concerned enough to check how healthy a product is. (Q21)","ALICE:   This <b>project has</b> actually taught me to read the labels much more carefully. I tended to believe claims on packaging like ‘low in fat’. But I now realise that the ‘healthy’<b> yoghurt </b>I’ve bought for years is full of sugar and that it’s <b>actually quite</b> <b>high in calories</b>. (Q22)","JACK:     Ready meals are the worst … comparing the labels on supermarket pizzas was a real eye-opener. <b><b>Did you have</b> any</b> idea how many calories they contain? I was amazed.","ALICE:   Yes, <b>because unless</b> you read the label really carefully, you wouldn’t know that the<b> nutritional </b>values given are for half a pizza. (Q23)","JACK:     When <b>most people</b> eat the whole pizza. Not exactly transparent is it?","ALICE:   Not at all. But I expect it won’t stop you from buying pizza?","JACK:     Probably not, no! I thought comparing the different <b><b>labelling systems</b> used</b> by food manufactures was interesting. I think the kind of labelling system used makes a <b>big difference</b>.","ALICE:   Which one did you prefer?","JACK:     I liked the traditional daily value system best – the one which tells you what proportion of your required daily intake of each ingredient the product contains. I’m not sure it’s the easiest for <b>people to use</b> but at least you get the full story (Q24). I <b>like to know</b> all the ingredients in a product – not <b>just how much</b> fat, salt and sugar they contain.","ALICE:   But it’s good <b>supermarkets have</b> been making an effort to provide reliable information for customers.","JACK:     Yes. There <b>just need</b>s to be more consistency between <b><b>labelling systems</b> used</b> by different supermarkets, in terms of portion sizes, etc.","ALICE:   Mmm. The labels on the different brands of <b>chicken flavour</b><b> crisps </b>were quite<b> revealing </b>too, weren’t they?","JACK:     Yeah. I don’t understand how they can <b>get away</b> with calling them <b>chicken flavour</b> when they only contain artificial additives. (Q25)","ALICE:   I know. I’d at least <b>have expected</b> them to contain a small percentage of real chicken.","JACK:     Absolutely.","ALICE:   I <b>think having</b> <b>nutritional food</b> labeling has been a <b>good idea</b>, don’t you? I think it will change people’s behaviour and stop mothers, in particular, buying the wrong things.","JACK:     But didn’t that study kind of prove the opposite? People didn’t necessarily <b>stop buying</b> unhealthy products.","ALICE:   They only said that might be the case.  Those findings weren’t that conclusive (Q26) and it was quite a small-scale study. I think more <b>research has</b> to be done.","JACK:     Yes, I think you’re <b>probably right</b>.","——————–","JACK:     What <b>do you think</b> of the traffic-light system?","ALICE:   I think supermarkets like the <b>idea of having</b> a colour-coded system – red, orange or green – for levels of fat, sugar and salt in a product.","JACK:     Buy it’s not been adopted universally (Q27&28). And not on all products. Why do you suppose that is?","ALICE:   Pressure from the <b>food manufacturers</b>. Hardly surprising that some of them are<b> opposed </b>to flagging up how unhealthy their products are.","JACK:     I’d <b>have thought</b> it would have been compulsory. It seems<b> ridiculous </b>it isn’t.","ALICE:   I know. And what I couldn’t get over is the fact that it was brought in without enough consultation – a lot of experts had deep<b> reservations </b>about it.","JACK:     That is a bit weird. I suppose there’s an argument for doing the research now when consumers are familiar with this system.","ALICE:   Yeah, maybe.","JACK:     The participants in the survey were quite positive about the traffic-light system.","ALICE:   Mmm. But I don’t think they targeted the <b>right people</b>. They should <b>have focused</b> on people with low literacy levels because these labels are designed to be accessible to them.","JACK:     Yeah. But it’s <b>good to get</b> feedback from all socio-economic groups (Q29&30). And there wasn’t much variation in their responses.","ALICE:   No. But if they hadn’t interviewed participants face-to-face, they could <b>have used</b> a <b>much bigger</b> sample size. I wonder why they chose that method?","JACK:     Dunno. How were they selected? Did they volunteer or were they approached?","ALICE:   I think they volunteered. The thing that wasn’t stated was how often they bought packaged food – all we know is how frequently they used the supermarket.","#4 The <b>history of coffee</b> Transcript","The Part 4 <b>audio script</b> of The <b>history of coffee</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 4 is as follows:","In my presentation, I’m <b>going to talk</b> about coffee, and its importance both in <b>economic and social</b> terms. We think it was first drunk in the Arab world, but there’s <b>hardly any</b> documentary evidence of it before the 1500s, al<b>though of course</b> that doesn’t <b>mean that people</b> didn’t know about it before then.","However, there is evidence that coffee was originally gathered from bushes growing wild in Ethiopia, in the northeast of Africa. In the early sixteenth century, it was being bought by traders, and gradually its use as a drink spread throughout the <b>Middle East</b>. It’s <b>also known</b> that in 1522, in the Turkish city of Constantinople, which was the centre of the Ottoman Empire, the court<b> physician </b>approved its use as a medicine.","By the mid-1500s, coffee bushes were being cultivated in the Yemen and for the next <b>hundred years</b> this region produced most of the coffee drunk in Africa and the Arab world. What’s <b>particularly interesting</b> about coffee is its effect on<b> social </b>life. It was rarely drunk at home, but instead people went to <b>coffee houses</b> to drink it. These people, usually men, would meet to drink coffee and chat about issues of the day.","But at the time, this chance to share ideas and opinions was seen as something that was <b>potentially dangerous</b>, and in 1623 the ruler of Constantinople demanded the destruction of all the <b>coffee houses</b> in the city (Q31), although after his death many <b>new ones</b> opened, and <b>coffee consumption</b> continued.","In the <b>seventeenth century</b>, coffee drinking spread to Europe, and <b>here too</b> coffee shops became places where <b>ordinary people</b>, nearly always men, could meet to exchange ideas. Because of this, <b>some people</b> said that these places performed a similar function to universities (Q32). The opportunity they provided for people to <b>meet together</b> outside their <b><b>own home</b>s</b> and to discuss the topics of the day had an <b>enormous impact</b> on<b> social </b>life, and many<b> social </b>movements and political developments had their origins in coffee house discussions. (Q33)","——————–","In the late 1600s, the Yemeni<b> monopoly </b>on <b>coffee production</b> <b>broke down</b> and <b>coffee production</b> started to spread a<b>round the world</b>, helped by European colonization. Europeans <b>set up</b> coffee<b> plantations </b>in Indonesia and the Caribbean and production of coffee in the colonies skyrocketed. <b>Different types</b> of coffee were produced in <b>different areas</b>, and it’s interesting that the names given to these <b>different types</b>, like Mocha or Java coffee, were often taken from the port they were shipped to Europe from (Q34). But if you look at the<b> labour </b>system in the different colonies, there were some significant differences.","In Brazil and the various Caribbean colonies, <b>coffee was grown</b> in huge<b> plantations </b>and the workers there were <b>almost all</b> slaves (Q35). But this wasn’t the <b>same in all</b> colonies; for example in Java, which had been<b> colonized </b>by the Dutch, the<b> peasants </b>grew coffee and passed a proportion of this on to the Dutch, so it was used as a means of<b> taxation </b>(Q36).","But whatever system was used, under the European powers of the <b>eighteenth century</b>, <b>coffee production</b> was <b>very close</b>ly linked to colonisation. <b>Coffee was grown</b> in ever-increasing quantities to satisfy the growing demand from Europe, and it <b>became nearly</b> as important as sugar production (Q37), which was grown under <b>very similar</b> conditions. However, <b>coffee prices</b> were not yet low enough for people to drink it regularly at home, so most <b>coffee consumption</b> still <b>took place</b> in public <b>coffee houses</b> and it still remained something of a luxury item.","In Britain, however, a new drink was introduced from China, and started to become popular, gradually taking over from coffee, although at first it was so expensive that only the upper classes could afford it. This was tea, and by the late 1700s it was being widely drunk. However, when the USA gained independence from Britain in 1766, they identified this drink with Britain, and coffee remained the<b> preferred </b>drink in the USA (Q38), as it still is today.","So, by the early <b>nineteenth century</b>, coffee was already being widely produced and consumed. But during this century, production boomed and <b>coffee prices</b> started to fall. This was <b>partly because</b> new types of transportation had been developed which were cheaper and more efficient (Q39).","So now, working people could <b>afford to buy</b> coffee – it wasn’t <b>just a drink</b> for the <b>middle classes</b>. And this was at a time when large parts of Europe were starting to work in industries. And sometimes this meant their work didn’t stop when it got dark; they might have to continue throughout the night (Q40). So, the use of coffee as a<b> stimulant </b>became important – it wasn’t <b>just a drink</b> people<b> drank </b>in the morning, for breakfast.","There were also changes in<b> cultivation </b>…"]},{"name":"GLS/14-1","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Crime Report Form Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of <b><b>Crime Report</b> Form</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 1 is as follows:","OFFICER:         <b>Good morning</b>.

My name’s Janet Parker and I’m the <b>human resources</b> manager. We’re <b>very happy</b> to welcome you to your <b>new apprentices</b>hip. I hope that the next <b>six months</b> will be a positive and <b>enjoyable experience</b> for you.","I’d <b>like to start</b> with <b>some general</b> advice about being an apprentice. Most of you have <b>very little</b> or <b>no experience</b> of working for a big organisation and the <b>first week</b> or so may be <b>quite challenging</b>. There will be a lot of new information to take in but don’t <b><b>worry too</b> much</b> about trying to remember everything. The <b>important thing</b> is to (Q11) check with someone if you’re not sure what to do – you’ll find your<b> supervisor </b>is very approachable and won’t mind <b>explaining things</b> or helping you out. You’re here to learn so <b>make the most</b> of that opportunity. You’ll be <b>spending time</b> in <b>different departments</b> during your <b>first week</b> so make an effort to (Q12) talk to as <b>many <b>people as possible</b></b> about their work – you’ll <b>make some</b> <b>new friends</b> and find out lots of useful information.","As <b>well as having</b> a supervisor, you’ll each be assigned a mentor. This person will be someone who’s recently completed an apprenticeship and you’ll meet with them on a weekly basis. Their <b>role is to provide</b> help and support throughout your apprenticeship. Of course, this doesn’t mean they’ll actually <b>do any</b> of your work for you – instead they’ll be asking you about (Q13) what goals you’ve achieved so far, as well as helping you to <b>identify any</b> areas for improvement. You can also (Q14) discuss your more long-term ambitions with them as well.","————————–","<b>Now I just</b> want to run through a few company policies for our apprenticeship scheme with you… <b>Most important</b>ly, the internet. As part of your job you’ll be <b>doing <b>some research</b></b> online so obviously you’ll have unlimited access for that but please (Q15) don’t use it for <b>personal use</b> – you’ll <b>have your own</b> phones for that.","<b>Some of you have</b> already asked me about <b>flexible working</b>. After your<b> probationary </b>three-month period – some of you will be eligible for this – but (Q16) it will depend on which department you’re in and what your <b>personal circumstances</b> are. So <b>please do</b>n’t assume you’ll automatically be<b> permitted </b>to do this.","<b>I </b> <b>want to make</b> sure there’s no confusion about our holiday policy. Apart from any<b> statutory </b>public holidays (Q17) we ask that you don’t book any holidays until after your six-month apprenticeship has finished. Time off should only be taken if you are unwell. Please speak to your<b> supervisor </b>if this is going to be a problem.","You’ll be expected to work a 40-hour week but there may be<b> opportunities </b>to <b>do overtime</b> during busy periods. Although you’re not required to do this, (Q18) it can be a <b>valuable experience</b> – so we advise you to <b>take it up</b> if possible. Obviously, we understand that <b>people do</b> have commitments outside work, so don’t worry if there are times when you are unavailable.","As you know, we don’t have a formal <b>dress code</b> here – you may wear casual clothes as long as they’re practical – and the only restriction for shoes we have is on <b>high heels</b> for <b><b>health and safety</b> reasons</b>. (Q19) Comfortable shoes like<b> trainers </b>are preferable.","There’s a heavily<b> subsidised </b>canteen on site where you can get hot meals or salads cheaply. Snacks and drinks are <b><b>also provide</b>d</b> – so (Q20) we’ve decided to introduce a no packed lunch policy. This is partly to <b><b>encourage healthy</b> eating</b> at work and partly to <b>stop people</b> from eating at their workstation, which is unhygienic.","<b>OK moving</b> on to …","#3 <b>Cities <b>built by the sea</b></b> Transcript","The Part 3 <b>audio transcript</b> of <b>Cities <b>built by the sea</b></b> in Cambridge 14 <b>Listening Test</b> 1 is as follows:","TUTOR:            OK, so what I’d like you to <b>do now</b> is to talk to your partner about your presentations on <b>urban planning</b>.

I’m glad we chose quite a specific topic – <b>cities built</b> next to the sea. It made it <b>much easier</b> to find <b>relevant information</b>.","ROB:                Yeah. And cities are growing so quickly – I mean, we know that more than half the world’s <b>population lives</b> in cities now.","CARLA:            Yeah, though that’s all cities, not <b>just one</b>s on the coast. But (Q21) most of the biggest cities are actually <b>built by the sea</b>. I’d not realised that before.","ROB:                Nor me. And what’s more, a lot of them are built at places where rivers come out into the sea. But apparently this can be a problem.","CARLA:            Why?","ROB:                Well, as the city expands, agriculture and industry tend to spread <b>further inland</b> along the rivers, and so agriculture moves even <b>further inland</b> up the river. That’s not necessarily a problem, except (Q22) it means more and more<b> pollutants </b>are discharged into the rivers.","CARLA:            So these are brought downstream to the cities?","ROB:                Right. Hmm. <b>Did you read</b> that article about Miami, on the <b>east coast</b> of the USA?","CARLA:            No.","ROB:                Well, apparently back in the 1950s they build channels to drain away the water in case of flooding.","CARLA:            <b>Sounds sensible</b>.","ROB:                Yeah, they spent quite a <b>lot of money</b> on them. (Q23) But what they didn’t <b>take into account</b> was <b>global warming</b>. So they built the<b> drainage </b>channels <b>too close</b> to sea level, and now <b>sea levels</b> are rising, they’re more or less useless. If there’s a lot of rain, the water can’t run away, there’s nowhere for it to go. The <b>whole design</b> was faulty.","CARLA:            So what are the authorities doing about it now?","ROB:                I don’t know. I did read that they’re aiming to stop disposing of waste into the ocean over the <b>next <b>ten years</b></b>.","CARLA:            But that won’t help with flood prevention now, will it?","ROB:                No. Really (Q24) they just <b>need to find</b> the money for something to replace the<b> drainage </b>channels, in <b>order to protect</b> against flooding now. But in the <b>long term</b> they <b>need to consider</b> the whole ecosystem.","CARLA:            Right. Really, though, <b>coastal cities</b> can’t deal with their problems on their own, can they? I mean, they’ve got to start acting together at an international level <b>instead of just</b> doing their own thing.","ROB:                Absolutely. The thing is, <b>everyone knows</b> what the problems are and environmentalists have a <b>pretty good</b> idea of what we should be doing about them, so (Q25) they should be able to <b>work together</b> to <b>some extent</b>. But it’s going to be a <b>long time</b> before countries come to a decision on what<b> principles </b>they’re prepared to abide by.","CARLA:            Yes, if they ever do.","——————————","CARLA:            So I think we’ve <b>probably got</b> enough for our presentation. It’s only fifteen minutes.","ROB:                OK. So I suppose we’ll begin with <b>some general</b> historical background about why <b>coastal cities</b> were established. But (Q26) we don’t <b>want to spend</b> <b>too long</b> on that, the <b>other students</b> will <b>already know</b> a bit about it. It’s <b>all to do</b> with communications and so on.","CARLA:            Yes. We should mention some<b> geographical </b>factors, <b>things like</b><b> wetlands </b>and river<b> estuaries </b>and coastal erosion and so on. We could <b>have some</b> maps of different cities with these features marked.","ROB:                On a<b> handout </b>you mean? Or (Q27) <b>some slides</b> <b>everyone can see</b>?","CARLA:            Yeah, that’d be better.","ROB:                It’d be good to go into past mistakes in a bit more detail. <b>Did you read</b> that <b>case study</b> of the problems there were in New Orleans with flooding a <b><b>few years</b> ago</b>?","CARLA:            Yes, (Q28) We could use that as the basis for that part of the talk. I don’t think the <b>other students</b> will <b>have read</b> it, but they’ll remember hearing about the flooding at the time.","ROB:                OK. So that’s probably enough background.","CARLA:            So then we’ll go on to talk about what action’s being taken to deal with the problems of <b>coastal cities</b>.","ROB:                OK. What else <b>do we need</b> to talk about? <b>Maybe something</b> on future risks, looking more at the <b>long term</b>, if populations continue to grow.","CARLA:            Yeah. We’ll <b>need to do</b> a bit of work there, I haven’t got <b>much information</b>, have you?","ROB:                No. (Q29) We’ll <b>need to look</b> at <b>some websites</b>. Shouldn’t <b><b>take too</b> long</b>.","CARLA:            OK. And I think we should end by talking about international implications. Maybe (Q30) we could <b>ask people</b> in the audience. We’ve got people from <b>quite a lot</b> of <b>different places</b>.","ROB:                That’d be interesting, if we <b>have time</b>, yes.

Demand is rising rapidly, because of the world’s increasing population and expanding (Q31) industry. Burning<b> fossil </b>fuels, like gas, coal and oil, seriously damages the environment and they’ll eventually run out. For a <b>number of years</b> now, scientists <b>have been working</b> out how we can derive energy from<b> renewable </b>sources, such as the sun and wind, without causing pollution. Today I’ll outline <b><b>marine renewable</b> energy</b> – <b>also called</b> ocean energy – which harnesses the movement of the oceans.","<b><b>Marine renewable</b> energy</b> can be divided into <b>three main</b> categories: wave energy, <b>tidal energy</b> and <b>ocean <b>thermal energy</b></b> conversion, and I’ll say a <b>few words</b> about <b>each one</b>.","First, wave energy.<b> Numerous </b>devices have been invented to harvest wave energy, with names such as Wave Dragon, the Penguin and Mighty Whale, and <b>research is going</b> on to try and <b>come up</b> with a really <b>efficient method</b>. This form of energy <b>has plenty</b> of potential, as the source is (Q32) constant, and there’s <b>no danger</b> of waves coming to a standstill. But the problem with ocean waves is that they’re erratic, with the wind making them travel in every (Q33) direction. This adds to the difficulty of creating efficient technology: ideally all the waves would travel smoothly and regularly along the same<b> straight </b>line. Another drawback is that sand and other<b> sediment </b>on the ocean (Q34) floor might be stopped from flowing normally, which can lead to environmental problems.","——————————–","The second <b>category of marine</b> energy that I’ll mention is <b>tidal energy</b>. <b>One major</b> advantage of using the tide, rather than waves, as a <b>source of energy</b> is that it’s (Q35) predictable: we know the exact time of <b><b>high and low</b> tides</b> for <b>years to come</b>.","For <b>tidal energy</b> to be effective, the difference between <b><b>high and low</b> tides</b> needs to be at <b>least five</b> metres, and this occurs naturally in only about forty places on Earth.","One current plan is to create a tidal<b> lagoon </b>on the coast of Wales. This will be an <b>area of water</b> within a (Q36) bay at Swansea, sheltered by a U-shaped breakwater, or dam, built out from the coast. The<b> breakwater </b>will contain sixteen<b> hydro </b>turbines, and as the tide rises, water rushes through the breakwater, activating the turbines, which turn a generator to <b>produce electricity</b>. Then, for <b>three hours</b> as the tide goes out, the water is <b>held back</b> within the breakwater, increasing the difference in water level, until it’s several <b>metres high</b>er within the<b> lagoon </b>than in the open sea.","Then, in order to release the stored water, (Q37) gates in the<b> breakwater </b>are opened. It<b> pours </b>powerfully out of the lagoon, driving the<b> turbines </b>in the<b> breakwater </b>in the <b>opposite direction</b> and again generating thousands of<b> megawatts </b>of electricity. As there are two high tides a day, this<b> lagoon </b>scheme would generate electricity <b>four times</b> a day, <b>every day</b>, for a total of around 14 hours in every 24 – and enough electricity for over 150,000 homes.","This system has <b>quite a lot</b> in its favour: unlike solar and wind energy it doesn’t depend on the weather; the<b> turbines </b>are operated without the need for (Q38) fuel, so it doesn’t create any <b>greenhouse gas</b> emissions; and <b>very little</b><b> maintenance </b>is needed. It’s<b> estimated </b>that electricity generated in this way will be relatively cheap, and that manufacturing the components would create than 2,000 (Q39) jobs, a big boost to the local economy.","On the other hand, there are fears that<b> lagoons </b>might harm both fish and birds, for example by disturbing (Q40) migration patterns, and causing a build-up of silt, affecting local ecosystems.","There are <b>other forms</b> of <b>tidal energy</b>, but I’ll go on to the third <b>category of marine</b> energy: <b>ocean <b>thermal energy</b></b> conversion. This depends on there being a <b>big difference</b> in<b> temperature </b>between surface water and the water a couple of kilo<b>metres below the surface</b>, and this occurs in tropical coastal areas. The idea is to bring <b>cold water</b> <b><b>up to the surface</b> using</b> a<b> submerged </b>pipe. The concept <b>dates back</b> to 1881, when …"]},{"name":"GLS/14-2","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Total Health Clinic Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of <b>Total <b>Health Clinic</b></b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 2 is as follows:","CARL:               Hi, come and take a seat.","JULIE:               Thank you.","CARL:               My name’s Carl Rogers and I’m one of the doctors here at the <b>Total <b>Health Clinic</b></b>.

The first building was a fort constructed in 914 AD for defence against Danish invaders by King Alfred the Great’s daughter, who ruled England at the time. In the following century, after the Normans<b> conquered </b>England, the land was given to a nobleman called Richard de Vere, and he built a<b> castle </b>there that stayed in the de Vere family for over <b>four <b>hundred years</b></b>.","However, when Queen Elizabeth I announced that she was going to visit the<b> castle </b>in 1576 it was beginning to look a bit run down, and it was decided that rather than repair the guest rooms, (Q11) they’d make a new house for her out of wood next to the <b>main hall</b>. She stayed there for four nights and apparently it was very luxurious, but unfortunately it was destroyed a few <b>years later</b> by fire.","In the <b>seventeenth century</b> the<b> castle </b>belonged to the wealthy Fenys family, who enlarged it and made it more comfortable. However, by 1982 the Fenys family could <b>no longer</b> afford to maintain the castle, <b>even though</b> they received government support, and they put it on the market. It was eventually taken over by (Q12) a company who owned a number of amusement parks, but when we get there I think you’ll see that they’ve managed to <b>retain the original</b> atmosphere of the castle.","When you go inside, you’ll find that in the state rooms (Q13) there are life-like moving wax models dressed in costumes of different periods in the past, which even carry on conversations together. As well as that, in every room there are booklets giving information about what the room was used for and the history of the objects and furniture it contains.","The<b> castle </b>park’s <b>quite extensive</b>. At <b>one time</b> sheep were kept there, and in the <b>nineteenth century</b> the owners had a little zoo with <b>animals like</b> rabbits and even a baby elephant. Nowadays the old zoo buildings are used for (Q14) public displays of painting and sculpture. The park <b>also has</b> some beautiful trees, though the oldest of all, which dated back 800 years, was sadly blown down in 1987.","Now, you’re free to wander around on your own until 4.30, but then at the end of our visit we’ll all <b>meet together</b> at the bottom of the Great Staircase. We’ll then go on to the long gallery, where there’s a wonderful collection of<b> photographs </b>showing the family who owned the<b> castle </b>a <b><b>hundred years</b> ago</b> having tea and cakes in the<b> conservatory </b>– and we’ll then take you to (Q15) the same place, where afternoon tea will be served to you.","——————————-","Now if you can <b>take a look</b> at your plans you’ll see <b>Branley Castle</b> has four towers, joined together by a high wall, with the river on <b>two sides</b>.","Don’t miss seeing the Great Hall. That’s near the river in the main tower, the biggest one, which was extended and<b> redesigned </b>in the <b>eighteenth century</b>.","If you want to <b>get a good</b> view of the whole castle, you can walk around the walls. (Q16) The <b>starting point</b>’s <b>quite near</b> the <b>main entrance</b> – walk<b> straight </b><b>down the path</b> <b>until you get</b> to the <b>south gate</b>, and it’s just there. Don’t go on to the north gate – there’s <b>no way</b> up from there.","There’ll shortly be a show in which you can see archers displaying their skill with a bow and arrow. The quickest <b>way to get</b> there is to (Q17) <b>take the <b>first <b>left after the main</b></b></b> entrance and follow the path past the bridge, then you’ll see it in front of you at the end.","If you like animals there’s also a display of<b> hunting </b>birds – falcons and eagles and so on. If you (Q18) go from the <b>main entrance</b> in the direction of the <b>south gate</b>, but <b>turn right</b> before you get there <b>instead of going</b> through it, you’ll see it on your right past the first tower.","At 3 pm there’s a short performance of traditional dancing on the (Q19) outdoor stage. That’s right at the <b>other side</b> of the<b> castle </b>from the entrance, and over the bridge. It’s about <b>ten minutes</b>’ walk or so.","And finally the shop. It’s actually (Q20) inside one of the towers, but the way in is from the outside. Just <b>take the <b>first <b>left after the main</b></b></b> entrance, go <b>down the path</b> and <b>take the first</b> right. It’s <b>got some</b> lovely gifts and souvenirs.","Right, so we’re just arriving …","#3 <b>Wolly Mammoths</b> Transcript","The Part 3 <b>audio transcript</b> of <b>Wolly Mammoths</b> on St Paul island in Cambridge 14 <b>Listening Test</b> 2 is as follows:","TUTOR:            So, Rosie and Martin, let’s look at what you’ve got for your presentation on <b><b>woolly mammoth</b>s</b>.","ROSIE:             OK, we’ve got a short outline here.","TUTOR:            Thanks. So it’s about a <b>research project</b> in <b>North America</b>?","MARTIN:         Yes. But we thought we needed something general about <b><b>woolly mammoth</b>s</b> in our introduction, to establish that they were related to our modern elephant, and they lived <b>thousands of years</b> ago in the <b><b>last ice</b> age</b>.","ROSIE:             Maybe we could show a <b>video clip</b> of a cartoon about mammoths. But that’d be a bit childish. Or we could have a diagram, (Q21) it could be a timeline to show when they lived, with illustrations?","MARTIN:         Or we could just show a drawing of them walking in the ice? No, let’s go with your last suggestion.","TUTOR:            Good. Then you’re describing the <b><b>discovery of the mammoth</b> tooth</b> on St Paul’s Island in Alaska, and why it was significant.","ROSIE:             Yes. The tooth was found by a man called Russell Graham. He picked it up from under a rock in a cave. He knew it was special – for a start it was in <b>really good</b> condition, as if it had been just extracted from the animal’s jawbone. Anyway, they found it was 6,500 <b>years old</b>.","TUTOR:            So why was that significant?","ROSIE:             Well (Q22) the<b> mammoth </b>bones previously found on the <b>North America</b>n mainland were <b>much less</b> recent than that. So this was really amazing.","MARTIN:         Then we’re making an animated diagram to show the<b> geography </b>of the area in <b>prehistoric times</b>. So originally, St Paul’s Island wasn’t an island, it was connected to the mainland, and<b> mammoths </b>and <b>other animals</b> like <b>bears were able</b> to<b> roam </b>around the <b>whole area</b>.","ROSIE:             Then the climate warmed up and the sea <b>level b</b>egan to rise, and the island got cut off from the mainland. So (Q23) those<b> mammoths </b>on the island couldn’t escape; they had to stay on the island.","MARTIN:         And in fact the<b> species </b>survived there for <b>thousands of years</b> after they’d <b>become extinct</b> on the mainland.","TUTOR:            So why <b>do you think</b> they died out on the mainland?","ROSIE:             <b>No one</b>’s sure.","MARTIN:         Anyway, next we’ll explain how Graham and his team identified the date when the<b> mammoths </b>became extinct on the island. They concluded that (Q24) the extinction happened 5,600 <b>years ago</b>, which is a very precise time for a<b> prehistoric </b>extinction. It’s based on samples they took from mud at the bottom of a lake on the island. They analysed it to find out what had fallen in over time – bits of plants, <b>volcanic ash</b> and even DNA from the<b> mammoths </b>themselves. It’s standard procedure, but it took <b>nearly two</b> years to do.","————————-","TUTOR:            So why don’t you quickly <b>go through the main</b> sections of your presentation and discuss what action’s needed for each part?","MARTIN:         OK. So for the introduction, we’re using a visual, so once we’ve prepared that we’re done.","ROSIE:             I’m not sure. I think (Q25) we <b>need to write</b> down all the ideas we <b>want to include</b> here, not just rely on memory. How we begin the presentation is so important …","MARTIN:         You’re right.","ROSIE:             The <b><b>discovery of the mammoth</b> tooth</b> is <b>probably the most</b> dramatic part, but we don’t have that <b>much information</b>, only what we got from the online article. I thought maybe (Q26) we could <b>get in touch</b> with the researcher who led the team and <b>ask him</b> to tell us a bit more.","MARTIN:          Great idea. What about the section with the initial questions asked by the researchers? We’ve <b>got a lot</b> on that but we <b>need to make</b> it interesting.","ROSIE:             We could (Q27) ask the audience to suggest <b>some questions</b> about it and then <b>see how many</b> of them we can answer. I don’t think it would <b><b>take too</b> long</b>.","TUTOR:            Yes that would <b>add a bit</b> of variety.","MARTIN:         Then the section on <b>further research</b> carried out on the island – analysing the mud in the lake. I wonder if we’ve actually got too <b>much information</b> here, should we cut some?","ROSIE:             I don’t think so, but it’s all a bit<b> muddled </b>at present.","MARTIN:         Yes, (Q28) maybe it would be better if it followed a<b> chronological </b>pattern.","ROSIE:             I think so. The findings and possible explanations section is just about ready, but we need to practice it (Q29) so we’re sure it won’t overrun.","MARTIN:          I think it should be OK, but yes, let’s <b>make sure</b>.","TUTOR:            In the last section,<b> relevance </b>to the <b>present day</b>, you’ve <b>got some</b> <b><b>good idea</b>s</b> but this is where you need to <b>move away</b> from the ideas of others and (Q30) give your own viewpoint.","MARTIN:         OK, we’ll think about that. Now shall we …","#4 <b>History of <b>weather forecasting</b></b> Transcript","The Part 4 <b>audio transcript</b> of The <b>History of <b>weather forecasting</b></b> in Cambridge 14 <b>Listening Test</b> 2 is as follows:","In this <b>series of lectures</b> about the <b>history of <b>weather forecasting</b></b>, I’ll start by examining its <b>early history</b> – that’ll be the subject of today’s talk.","Ok, so we’ll start by <b>going back</b> <b>thousands of years</b>. Most ancient cultures had weather gods, and weather catastrophes, such as floods, <b><b>played an important</b> role</b> in many creation myths.","For instance, there’s the Egyptian <b>sun god</b> Ra, and Thor, the Norse god of<b> thunder </b>and lightning. Many <b>ancient civilisations</b> developed<b> rites </b>such as (Q31) dances in <b>order to make</b> the weather gods look kindly on them.","But the weather was of daily importance: observing the skies and drawing the correct conclusions from these observations was <b>really important</b>, in fact their (Q32) survival depended on it. It isn’t known when people first started to observe the skies, but at around 650 BC, the Babylonians produced the first short-range weather forecasts, based on their observations of (Q33) clouds and other phenomena. The Chinese also recognised weather patterns, and by 300 BC, astronomers had developed a calendar which divided the year into 24 (Q34) festivals, each associated with a <b>different weather</b> phenomenon.","The <b><b>ancient Greek</b>s</b> were the first to develop a more scientific approach to explaining the weather. The work of the<b> philosopher </b>and scientist Aristotle, in the fourth century BC, is especially noteworthy, as his ideas held<b> sway </b>for nearly 2,000 years. In 340 BC, he wrote a book in which he attempted to account for the formation of rain, clouds, wind and storms.","He also described<b> celestial </b>phenomena such as<b> haloes </b>– that is, bright circles of light around the sun, the moon and bright stars – and (Q35) comets. Many of his observations were surprisingly accurate. For example, he believed that heat could cause water to evaporate. Errors like this were<b> rectified </b>from the Renaissance onwards.","———————–","For nearly 2,000 years, Aristotle’s work was accepted as the chief authority on weather theory. Alongside this, though, in the <b>Middle Ages</b> weather observations were passed on in the form of proverbs, such as ‘Red (Q36) sky at night, shepherd’s delight; red sky in the morning, shepherd’s warning’. Many of these are based on <b>very good</b> observations and are accurate, as contemporary<b> meteorologists </b><b>have discovered</b>.","For centuries, any attempt to forecast the weather could only be based on personal observation, but in the fifteenth century scientists began to see the need for (Q37) instruments. Until then, the <b><b>only one</b>s</b> available were weather<b> vanes </b>– to determine the wind direction – and early versions of rain gauges. <b>One of the first</b>, invented in the fifteenth century, was a hygrometer, which measured humidity. This was one of many inventions that contributed to the development of <b>weather forecasting</b>.","In 1592, the Italian scientist and inventor Galileo developed the world’s first (Q38) thermometer. His student Torricelli later invented the barometer, which <b>allowed people</b> to measure<b> atmospheric </b>pressure. In 1648, the French<b> philosopher </b>Pascal proved that pressure decreases with altitude. This discovery was verified by English astronomer Halley in 1686, and Halley was also the <b>first person</b> to map <b>trade winds</b>.","This increasing ability to measure factors related to weather helped scientists to understand the atmosphere and its processes better, and they started collecting weather observation data systematically. In the <b>eighteenth century</b>, the scientist and<b> politician </b>Benjamin Franklin carried out work on electricity and lightning in particular, but he was also <b>very interested</b> in weather and studied it throughout most of his life. It was Franklin who discovered that (Q39) storms generally travel from west to east.","In addition to new<b> meteorological </b>instruments, <b>other developments</b> contributed to our understanding of the atmosphere. People in <b>different locations</b> began to keep records, and in the mid-<b>nineteenth century</b>, the invention of the (Q40) telegraph <b>made it possible</b> for these records to be collated. This led, by the <b>end of the nineteenth</b> century, to the first weather services.","It was not until the early <b>twentieth century</b> that<b> mathematics </b>and<b> physics </b><b>became part</b> of meteorology, and we’ll continue from that point <b>next week</b>."]},{"name":"GLS/14-3","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Flanders conference hotel Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of <b><b>Flanders conference</b> hotel</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 3 is as follows:","ANGELA:         Hello, <b><b>Flanders conference</b> hotel</b>.","MAN:               Oh, hi.

My name’s Lucy Crittenden, and I’m the Director of Operations for an organisation that arranges volunteering in this part of the country. I’m<b> hoping </b>I can persuade <b>one or two</b> of you to become volunteers yourselves. <b>Let me</b> start by briefly explaining what we mean by volunteering.","Volunteers are teenagers and adults who choose to <b>spend some</b> time, unpaid, <b>helping other</b> people in <b>some way</b>. <b>Most volunteers</b><b> devote </b><b>two or three</b> hours to this every week, <b>while a few</b> do much more. The people they help may <b>have physical</b> or behavioural difficulties, for example.","Volunteers can do <b>all sorts</b> of things, depending on their own abilities and interests. If they’re supporting a family that’s struggling, for example, they may be <b>able to give</b> them tips on cooking, or recommend how to plan their budget or how to shop<b> sensibly </b>on their income. They might <b>even do</b> (Q11) <b>some painting</b> or wallpapering, perhaps alongside any <b>members of the family</b> who are <b>able to do</b> it. Or <b>even do</b> (Q12) some babysitting so that parents can go out for a while.","The benefit from volunteering isn’t only for the people being helped. Volunteers <b>also gain</b> from it: they’re <b>using their skills</b> to cope with somebody’s mental or physical ill health, and (Q13) volunteering may be a valuable element of their CV when they’re applying for jobs: employers usually look favourably on someone who’s <b>given up</b> <b>time to help</b> others. Significantly, <b>most volunteers</b> (Q14) feel that what they’re doing gives them a purpose in their lives. And in my opinion, they’re lucky in that respect, as <b>many people</b> don’t have that feeling.","——————–","Now I’d <b>like to tell</b> you what some of our volunteers <b>have said</b> about what they do, to <b>give you an idea</b> of the range of ways in which they can <b>help people</b>.","Habib supports an elderly lady who’s <b>beginning to show</b> signs of dementia. <b>Once a week</b> they, along with other elderly people, go to the local <b>community centre</b>, where a <b>group of people</b> come in and sing. The songs (Q15) take the listeners back to their youth, and for a little while they can forget the difficulties that they face now.","Our volunteer Consuela is an amazing woman. (Q16) She <b>has difficulty</b> walking herself, but she doesn’t let that stop her. She helps a <b>couple of people</b> with similar difficulties, who had almost stopped walking altogether. By using herself as an example, Consuela encourages them to walk more and more.","Minh visits a <b>young man</b> who lives alone and can’t leave his home on his own, so he <b>hardly ever</b> saw anyone. But together (Q17) they go out to the cinema, or to see friends the <b>young man</b> hadn’t been able to visit for a <b>long time</b>.","Tanya visits an elderly woman <b>once a week</b>. When the woman found out that Tanya is a professional dressmaker, she <b>got interested</b>. Tanya showed her some soft toys she’d made, and (Q18) the woman <b>decided to try</b> it herself. And now she really enjoys it, and spends hours <b>making toys</b>. They’re not perhaps up to Tanya’s standard yet, but she gains a lot of pleasure from doing it.","Alexei is a volunteer with a family that faces a number of difficulties. By calmly talking over possible solutions with <b>family member</b>s, he’s helping them to realise that they aren’t helpless, and that (Q19) they can <b><b>do some</b>thing</b> themselves to improve their situation. This has been great for their self-esteem.","And the last volunteer I’ll mention, though there are plenty more, is Juba. She volunteers with a teenage girl with learning difficulties, who wasn’t <b>very good</b> at talking to <b>other people</b>. Juba’s worked very patiently with her, (Q20) and now the girl is <b>far better</b> at expressing herself, and at understanding <b>other people</b>.","OK, I hope that’s given you an idea of what volunteering is all about. Now I’d like …","#3 <b><b>School Marching</b> Band</b> Transcript","The Part 3 <b>audio transcript</b> of <b><b>School Marching</b> Band</b> in Cambridge 14 <b>Listening Test</b> 3 is as follows:","LIZZIE:            So how are you getting on with your teaching practice at the <b>High School</b>, Joe?","JOE:                 Well I’ve been <b>put in charge</b> of the <b><b>school marching</b> band</b>, and it’s quite a responsibility. I’d like to talk it over with you.","LIZZIE:             <b>Go ahead</b>. You’d better start by giving <b>me a bit</b> of background.","JOE:                 OK. Well the <b>band has</b> students in it from <b>all year</b>s, so they’re aged 11 to 18, and there are about (Q21) 50 of them altogether. It’s quite a popular activity within the school. I’ve never worked with a band of more than 20 before, and this is <b>very different</b>.","LIZZIE:              I can imagine.","JOE:                 They aren’t really <b>good enough</b> to enter national band competitions, but they’re in a (Q22) regional one later in the term. Even if they don’t win, and I don’t expect them to, hopefully it’ll be an incentive for them to <b>try and improve</b>.","LIZZIE:             Yes, hopefully.","JOE:                 Well, now the <b>town council</b>’s organising a (Q23)<b> carnival </b>in the summer, and the <b>band has</b> been asked to perform. If you ask me, they aren’t <b>really up</b> to it yet, and I <b>need to get</b> them functioning better as a band, and in a very <b>short time</b>.","LIZZIE:             Have you been <b>doing anything</b> with them? Apart from practising the music, I mean.","JOE:                 I played a recording I <b>came across</b>, of a (Q24) drummer talking about how playing in a <b>band had</b> changed his life. I think it was an after-dinner speech. I thought it was pretty inspiring, because being in the <b>band had</b> stopped him from getting involved in crime. The students seemed to find it interesting, too.","LIZZIE:             That’s good.","JOE:                 I’m planning to show them that old (Q25) film from the 1940s ‘Strike Up the Band’, and talk about it with the students. What <b>do you think</b>?","LIZZIE:             <b>Good idea</b>. As it’s about a school band, it might make the students realise how much they can achieve if they <b>work together</b>.","JOE:                 That’s what I’ve got in mind. I’m<b> hoping </b>I can <b>take some</b> of the band to a (Q26)<b> parade </b>that’s <b>going to take</b> place <b>next month</b>. A couple of <b>marching band</b>s will be performing, and the atmosphere should be quite exciting. It <b>depends on whether</b> I can persuade the school to hire a coach or two to take us there.","LIZZIE:             Mmm. They <b>sound like</b> <b><b>good idea</b>s</b> to me.","JOE:                 Thanks.","—————————","JOE:                 Can I tell you about a <b>few people</b> in the band who I’m finding it <b>quite difficult</b> to cope with? I’m sure you’ll <b>have <b><b>some idea</b>s</b></b> about what I can do.","LIZZIE:             <b>Go ahead</b>.","JOE:                 There’s a<b> flautist </b>who says she loves playing in the band. We<b> rehearse </b><b>twice a week</b> after school, but (Q27) she’s <b>hardly ever</b> there. Then she looks for me the next day and gives me a very plausible reason – she says she had to help her mother, or she’s been ill, but to be honest, I don’t believe her.","LIZZIE:             <b>Oh dear</b>! Any more students with difficulties?","JOE:                 Plenty! There’s a<b> trumpeter </b>who thinks she’s the best<b> musician </b>in the band, though she certainly isn’t. (Q28) She’s always saying what she thinks <b>other people</b> should do, which makes my job pretty difficult.","LIZZIE:             She sounds a bit of a nightmare!","JOE:                 You can say that again. One of the<b> trombonists </b>has got an<b> impressive </b>sense of rhythm, and could be an<b> excellent </b>musician – except that (Q29) he has breathing difficulties, and he doesn’t really <b>have enough</b><b> breath </b>for the trombone. He’d be <b>much better</b> of playing percussion, for instance, but he <b>refuses to give</b> up. So he ends up only playing half the notes.","LIZZIE:             I suppose you have to admire his determination.","JOE:                 Maybe. One of the<b> percussionists </b>isn’t <b>too bad</b>, but (Q30) he never seems to interact with <b>other people</b>, and he always rushes off as soon as the<b> rehearsal </b>ends. I don’t know if there are family reasons, or what.

These will be public performances, and the <b>programme has</b> just been finalised. The theme of the festival is links between the UK and Australia, and this is reflected in the music: each concert will feature both British and <b>Australian composers</b>. I’ll tell you briefly about the Australian music, as you probably won’t be familiar with that.","The first concert will include music by Liza Lim, who was born in Perth, Western Australia, in 1966. As a child, Lim originally <b>learned to play</b> the piano – like so <b>many children</b> – and also the (Q31) violin. She found this was her real strength, and she studied and later taught composition, both in Australia and in <b>other countries</b>. As a composer, she has received<b> commissions </b>from<b> numerous </b>orchestras, other performers and festivals in <b>several countries</b>.","Liza Lim’s<b> compositions </b>are vibrant and full of (Q32) energy, and she often<b> explores </b>Asian and Australian Aboriginal cultural sources, including the native instrument, the didgeridoo: this is featured in a work called The Compass. Her music is very expressive, so although it is (Q33) complex, it <b>has the power</b> of connecting with audiences and performers alike.","In the festival we’re going to give a semi-staged performance of The Oresteia. This is an (Q34) opera in seven parts, based on the<b> trilogy </b>of <b>ancient Greek</b> tragedies by Aeschylus. Lim composed this when she was in her mid-20s, and she also wrote the text, along with Barrie Kosky. It’s performed by six singers, a dancer, and an<b> orchestra </b>that, as well as standard<b> orchestral </b>instruments, includes electric guitar, and a traditional Turkish<b> stringed </b>instrument. Lim wrote that because the stories in the tragedies are not easy to tell, the sounds she creates are also (Q35) disturbing, and they include breathing, sobbing, laughing and whistling. The work lasts around 75 minutes, and the rest of the concert will consist of<b> orchestral </b>works by the <b>British composers</b> Ralph Vaughan Williams and Frederick Delius.","——————————-","Moving on now to our second concert, this will begin with instrumental music by <b>British composers</b> – Benjamin Britten and Judith Weir. After the interval we’ll go to Australia for a piece by Ross Edwards: The <b>Tower of Remoteness</b>. According to Edwards, the<b> inspiration </b>for this piece came from nature, when he was sitting alone in the dry bed of a creek,<b> overshadowed </b>by the leaves of <b>palm trees</b>, listening to the <b>birds and insects</b>. The <b>Tower of Remoteness</b> is scored for piano and (Q36) clarinet. Edwards says he realised years after writing the piece that he had<b> subconsciously </b>modelled its opening phrase on a bird call.","Ross Edwards was born in 1943 in Sydney, Australia, and studied at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music and the universities of Adelaide and Sydney. He’s <b>well known</b> in Australia, and in fact he’s one of the country’s most performed composers. He’s written a <b>wide range</b> of music, from<b> symphonies </b>and<b> concertos </b>to some composed specifically for children. Edward’s <b>music has</b> been described as being ‘deeply connected to Australia’, and it can be regarded as a celebration of the (Q37) diversity of cultures that Australia can be proud of.","The last of the three <b>Australian composers</b> to be represented in our festival is Carl Vine. Born in 1954, Vine, like Liza Lim, comes from Perth, Western Australia. He <b>took up</b> the<b> cornet </b>at the age of five, switching to the piano <b>five <b>years later</b></b>. However, he went to university to study (Q38) physics, before changing to composition. After graduating he moved to Sydney and worked as a freelance<b> pianist </b>and composer. Before long he <b>had become</b> prominent in Australia as a<b> composer </b>for (Q39) dance, and in fact has written 25 scores of that type.","In our third concert, Vine will be represented by his music for the flag hand-over ceremony of the (Q40) Olympics held in 1996."]},{"name":"GLS/14-4","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Enquiry about booking hotel room Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of <b><b><b>Enquiry about booking</b> hotel</b> room</b> for an event in <b>Listening Test</b> 4 is as follows:","ANDREW:        <b>Good morning</b>, Clare House Hotel.

I’m arranging a party for my parents’ fiftieth wedding anniversary, and I’m ringing to ask about <b>hiring a room</b> <b>some time</b> next September. Also my parents and several of the guests will <b>need accommodation</b>.","ANDREW:        OK, I’m sure we can help you with that. Will you be having a sit-down meal or a buffet?","SAM:               Probably a sit-down.","ANDREW:        And <b>do you know</b> how <b>many people</b> there’ll be?","SAM:               Around eighty, I think.","ANDREW:        Well we <b>have two</b> rooms that can hold that number. One is the <b>Adelphi Room</b>. That can seat (Q1) eighty-five, or hold over a hundred if people are standing for a buffet.","SAM:               Right.","ANDREW:        If you have live music, there’s room for <b>four or five</b><b> musicians </b>in the gallery overlooking the room. Our guests usually appreciate the fact that the music can be loud enough for dancing, but not <b>too loud</b> for conversation.","SAM:               Yes, I <b>really do</b>n’t like it when you can’t talk.","ANDREW:        Exactly. Now the <b>Adelphi Room</b> is at the back of the hotel, and there are French windows leading out onto the terrace.

I think either of those rooms would be suitable.","ANDREW:        Can I <b>tell you about some</b> of the options we offer in addition?","SAM:               <b>Please do</b>.","ANDREW:        As well as a meal, you can have an MC, a Master of Ceremonies, who’ll be with you throughout the party.","SAM:               What exactly is the MC’s function? I suppose they make a (Q5) speech <b>during the meal</b> if we need one, do they?","ANDREW:        That’s right. All our MCs are trained as public speakers, so they can <b>easily get</b> people’s attention – many guests are glad to <b><b>have some</b>one</b> who can <b>make themselves</b> heard above the chatter! And they’re also your (Q6) support – if anything goes wrong, the MC will deal with it, so you can relax.","SAM:               Great! I’ll need to ask you about food, but something else that’s important is accommodation. You obviously have rooms in the hotel, but do you <b>also have</b> <b>any other</b> accommodation, like (Q7) cabins, for example?","ANDREW:        Yes, there are five in the grounds, all self-contained. They each <b>sleep two</b> to <b>four people</b> and <b>have their own</b> <b>living room</b>, bathroom and small kitchen.","SAM:               That <b>sounds perfect</b> for what we’ll need.","——————————","SAM:               Now you have various facilities, don’t you? Are they all <b>included in the price</b> of hiring the room? The pool, for instance.","ANDREW:        Normally you’d be <b>able to use</b> it, but (Q8) it’ll be closed throughout September for refurbishment, I’m afraid.

I’m Jake Stevens and I’m your rep here at the hotel. I’m sure you’ll all <b>have a great</b> time here. So <b>let <b>me <b>tell you a bit</b></b></b> about what’s on offer. I’ll start by <b>telling you about some</b> of the<b> excursions </b>that are available for guests.","<b>One thing</b> you <b>have to do</b> while you’re here is go dolphin watching. On our boat trips, we <b>pretty well</b><b> guarantee </b>you’ll <b>see dolphins</b> – if you don’t you can repeat the trip <b>free of charge</b>. We organise daily trips for just 35 euros. Unfortunately (Q11) there aren’t any places left for this afternoon’s trip, but <b>come and see</b> me to book for later in the week.","If you’re energetic, I’d recommend our forest walk. It’s a guided walk of about seven kilometres. There’ll be a stop half way, and (Q11) you’ll be provided with a drink and sandwiches. There’s some fairly<b> steep </b><b>climbs up</b> the hills, so you need to be reasonably fit for this one, with good shoes, and bring a<b> waterproof </b>in case it rains. It’s just 25<b> euros </b>all inclusive, and it’s every Wednesday.","Then on Thursdays we organise a cycle trip, which will give you all the fun of biking without the effort. We’ll take you and your bike up to the top of Mount Larna, and leave you to bike back – (Q13) it’s a 700-metre drop in just 20 kilometres so this isn’t really for<b> inexperienced </b>cyclists as you’ll be going <b>pretty fast</b>. And if it’s a clear day, you’ll <b>have fantastic</b> views.","On our local<b> craft </b>tour you can find out about the traditional activities in the island. And the <b>best thing</b> about this trip is that (Q14) it’s <b>completely free</b>. You’ll be taken to a factory where<b> jewellery </b>is made, and also a<b> ceramics </b>centre. If you want, you can buy some of the products but that’s <b>entirely up</b> to you. The trip starts after lunch on Thursday, and you’ll return by 6 pm.","If you’re interested in astronomy you may <b>already know</b> that the island’s <b>one of the best</b> <b>places in the world</b> to observe the night sky. We can offer trips to the<b> observatory </b>on Friday for those who are interested. They cost 90<b> euros </b><b>per person</b> and you’ll be shown the huge telescopes and have a talk from an expert, who’ll explain all about how they work. (Q15) Afterwards we’ll head down to Sunset Beach, where you can have a dip in the ocean if you want before we head off back to the hotel.","Finally, there’s <b>horse riding</b>. This is organised by the Equestrian Centre over near Playa Cortino and it’s a great experience if you’re a keen horseback rider, (Q16) or even if you’ve never been on a horse before. They take you down to the beach, and you can<b> canter </b>along the sand and through the waves. It costs 35<b> euros </b>and it’s available <b>every day</b>.","———————————-","So there’s plenty to do in the daytime, but what about night life?","Well, the <b>number one</b> attraction’s called ‘Musical Favourites’. Guests enjoy a three-course meal and unlimited free drinks, and watch a fantastic show, starting with musicals set in Paris and then crossing the Atlantic to <b>Las Vegas</b> and finally Copacabana. At the end the (Q17) cast members come down from the stage, still in their<b> stunning </b>costumes, and you’ll <b>have a chance</b> to chat with them. It’s hugely popular, so <b>let <b>me know</b></b> now if you’re interested because (Q18) it’s <b>no good</b> leaving it <b>until the last</b> minute. It’s on Friday night. Tickets are just 50<b> euros </b>each, but for an extra 10<b> euros </b>you can have a table right by the stage.","If you’d <b>like to go</b> <b>back in time</b>, there’s the<b> Castle </b>Feast on <b>Saturday evening</b>. It’s held in a twelfth-century castle, and you eat in the great courtyard, with ladies in long<b> gowns </b>serving your food. You’re given a whole chicken each, which you eat in the<b> medieval </b>way, (Q19) using your hands instead of cutlery, and you’re entertained by competitions where the horseback riders attempt to knock <b>one another</b> off their horses.

You said you wanted to talk about the course I’m taking on literature for children.","STEPHANIE:     That’s right. I’m <b>thinking of doing</b> it <b>next year</b>, but I’d <b>like to find</b> out more about it first.","TREVOR:          OK, well, as you probably know, it’s a one-year course. It’s divided into six modules, and you <b>have to take</b> all of them. <b>One of the most</b> interesting ones, for me, at least, was about the purpose of children’s literature.","STEPHANIE:     You mean, whether it should just entertain children or should be educational, as well.","TREVOR:          Right, and whether the teaching should be<b> factual </b>– giving them information about the world – or ethical, teaching them values. What’s fascinating is that (Q21) the writer isn’t necessarily<b> conscious </b>of the message they’re conveying. For instance, a story might show a child who has a problem as a result of not doing what an adult has told them to do, implying that children should always obey adults.","STEPHANIE:     I <b>see what you mean</b>.","TREVOR:          That module <b>made me</b> realise how important stories are – they can have a <b>significant effect</b> on children as they <b>grow up</b>. Actually, (Q22) it inspired me to <b>have a go</b> at it myself, just for my own interest. I know can’t compete with the really popular stories, like the Harry Potter books – they’re <b>very good</b>, and even young kids like my seven-year-old niece love reading them.","STEPHANIE:     Mm. I’m <b>very interested</b> in illustrations in stories. Is that covered in the course?","TREVOR:          Yes, there’s a module on pictures, and how they’re sometimes <b>central to the story</b>.","STEPHANIE:     That’s good. I remember some<b> frightening </b>ones I saw as a child and I can <b>still see</b> them vividly in my mind, <b>years later</b>! Pictures can be so powerful, just as powerful as words. I’ve always enjoyed drawing, so (Q23) that’s the field I <b>want to go</b> into when I finish the course. I bet that module will be <b>really helpful</b>.","TREVOR:          I’m sure it will. We also studied comics in that module, but I’m not convinced of their value, not compared with books. <b><b>One of the great</b> things</b> about words is that you use your imagination, but with a comic you don’t have to.","STEPHANIE:     There are plenty of kids who wouldn’t even try to read a book, so I think (Q24) comics can serve a <b>really useful</b> purpose.","TREVOR:          You mean, it’s better to read a comic than not to read at all? Yes, I suppose you’re right. I just think its sad when children don’t read books.","STEPHANIE:     What about books for girls and books for boys? Does the course go into that?","TREVOR:          Yes, there’s a module on it. For years, lots of stories, in English, at least, assumed that boys went out and did adventurous things and girls stayed at home and <b>played with dolls</b>. I was amazed (Q25) how many books were targeted at <b>just one</b> sex or the other. Of course this reflects society as it is when the books are written.","STEPHANIE:     That’s true. So it <b>sounds as though</b> you think it’s a good course.","TREVOR:          Definitely.","———————————-","TREVOR:          Have you been reading lots of children’s stories, to <b><b>help you decide</b> whether</b> to take the course?","STEPHANIE:     Yeah. I’ve gone as <b>far back</b> as the late <b>seventeenth century</b>, though I know there were earlier children’s stories.","TREVOR:          So <b>does that mean</b> you’ve read Perrault’s <b>fairy tales</b>? Cinderella, The Sleeping Beauty, and so on.","STEPHANIE:     Yes. They must be important, (Q26) because no stories of that type had been written before, there were the first. Then there’s The <b>Swiss Family</b> Robinson.","TREVOR:          I haven’t read that.","STEPHANIE:     The English name makes it sound as though Robinson is the family’s surname, but a more accurate translation would be The Swiss Robinsons, because it’s about (Q27) a <b>Swiss family</b> who are shipwrecked, like Robinson Crusoe in the novel of a century earlier.","TREVOR:          Well I <b>never knew</b> that!","STEPHANIE:     <b>Have you read</b> Hoffmann’s The Nutcracker and the Mouse King?","TREVOR:          Wasn’t that (Q28) the basis for Tchaikovsky’s ballet The Nutcracker?","STEPHANIE:     That’s right. It <b>has some</b> quite<b> bizarre </b>elements.","TREVOR:          I hope you’ve read Oscar Wilde’s The <b>Happy Prince</b>. It’s probably my favourite children’s story of <b>all time</b>.","STEPHANIE:     <b>Mine too</b>! And it’s so surprising, because Wilde is <b>best known</b> for his plays, and most of them are very witty, but The <b>Happy Prince</b> is really moving. (Q29) I struggled with Tolkien’s The <b>Lord of the Rings</b> – there long books, and I <b>gave up</b> after one.","TREVOR:          It’s extremely popular, though.","STEPHANIE:     Yeah, but whereas <b>something like</b> The <b>Happy Prince</b> just carried me along with it, The <b>Lord of the Rings</b> took more effort than I was <b>prepared to give</b> it.","TREVOR:          I didn’t find that – I love it.","STEPHANIE:     <b>An<b>other one</b></b> I’ve read is War Horse.","TREVOR:          <b>Oh yes</b>. It’s about the First Word War, isn’t it? (Q30) Hardly what you’d expect for a children’s story.","STEPHANIE:     Exactly, but it’s been <b>very successful</b>. <b>Have you read</b> any …","#4 <b>Hunt for <b>sunken settlements</b></b> Transcript","The Part 4 <b>audio transcript</b> of <b>Hunt for <b>sunken settlements</b></b> and ancient<b> shipwrecks </b>in Cambridge 14 <b>Listening Test</b> 4 is as follows:","In today’s class I’m <b>going to talk</b> about marine archaeology, the branch of archaeology focusing on human interaction with the sea, lakes and rivers. It’s the study of ships, cargoes, shipping facilities, and other physical remains. I’ll give you an example, then go on to show how this <b>type of research</b> is being transformed by the use of the latest technology.","Atlit-Yam was a village on the coast of the eastern Mediterranean, which <b>seems to have</b> been thriving until around 7,000 BC. The<b> residents </b>kept cattle, caught fish and stored grain. They had wells for fresh water, many of their houses were built around a courtyard and were constructed of stone. The village contained an<b> impressive </b>monument: seven half-tonne stones standing in a<b> semicircle </b>around a (Q31) spring, that might <b>have been used</b> for ceremonial purposes.","Atlit-Yam may have been destroyed<b> swiftly </b>by a tsunami, or <b>climate change</b> may have caused<b> glaciers </b>to melt and <b>sea levels</b> to rise, flooding the village gradually. Whatever the cause, it now lies ten <b>metres below the surface</b> of the Mediterranean, buried under sand at the bottom of the sea.","For marine archaeologists, Atlit-Yam is a <b>treasure trove</b>. Research on the buildings, (Q32) tools and the <b>human remains</b> <b>has revealed</b> how the<b> bustling </b>village once functioned, and even what diseases some of its<b> residents </b>suffered from. But of course this is <b>only one</b> small village, one window into a lost world. For a<b> fuller </b>picture, researchers need more <b>sunken settlements</b>, but the <b>hard part</b> is finding them.","Autonomous underwater vehicles, or AUVs, are used in the oil industry, for instance, to create (Q33) maps of the<b> seabed </b>before<b> rigs </b>and pipelines are installed. To navigate they use sensors, <b>such as compasses</b> and sonar. Until relatively recently they were <b>very expensive</b>, and so (Q34) heavy that they had to be launched from a large<b> vessel </b>with a winch.","————————","But the latest AUVs are <b>much easier</b> to<b> manoeuvre </b>– they can be launched from the shore or a small ship. And they’re much cheaper, which makes them more accessible to research teams. They can communicate with <b>each other</b> and, for example, work out the <b>most efficient</b> way to survey a site, or to find particular objects on the seabed.","<b>Field tests</b> show the approach can work. For example, in a trial in 2015, three AUVs searched for<b> wrecks </b>at Marzamemi, off the coast of Sicily. The site is the final resting place of an <b>ancient Roman</b> ship, which sank in the <b>sixth century</b> AD while ferrying<b> prefabricated </b>(Q35) marble elements for the construction of an early church. The AUVs mapped the area in detail, finding other ships carrying columns of the <b>same material</b>.","Creating an internet in the sea for AUVs to communicate is no easy matter. Wifi networks on <b>land use</b><b> electromagnetic </b>waves, but in water these will only travel a <b>few centimetres</b>. Instead, a more complex mix of technologies is required. For short distances, AUVs can share date using (Q36) light, while acoustic waves are used to communicate over <b>long distances</b>.","There’s also a system that enables AUVs to share information from<b> seabed </b>scans, and other data. So if an AUV surveying the<b> seabed </b>finds an<b> intriguing </b>object, it can share the coordinates of the object – that is, its position – with a nearby AUV that carries<b> superior </b>(Q37) cameras, and arrange for that AUV to make a closer inspection of the object.","Marine archaeologists are excited about the huge potential of these AUVs for their discipline. <b>One site</b> where they’re going to be deployed is the Gulf of Baratti, off the Italian coast. In 1974, a 2,000-year-old Roman<b> vessel </b>was discovered here, in 18 metres of water. When it sank, it was carrying (Q38) medical goods, in wooden or<b> tin </b>receptacles. Its cargo <b>gives us insight</b> into the treatments available <b>all those years</b> ago, including tablets that are <b>thought to have</b> been<b> dissolved </b>to form a<b> cleansing </b>liquid for the (Q39) eyes.","Other Roman ships <b>went down</b> nearby, taking their cargoes with them. Some held huge<b> pots </b>made of terracotta. Some were used for transporting cargoes of olive oil, and others held (Q40) wine. In many cases it’s only these containers that remain, while the wooden ships have been buried under<b> silt </b>on the seabed.","Another project that’s about to …"]},{"name":"GLS/15-1","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Bankside Recruitment Agency Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of <b><b>Bankside Recruitment</b> Agency</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 1 is as follows:","AMBER:               Hello William.

I wouldn’t call her until the afternoon (Q2) if I were you – she’s always really busy in the morning trying to fill last-minute vacancies. She’s <b>really helpful</b> and friendly so I’m sure it would be worth getting in touch with her for an informal chat.","AMBER:               It’s mainly<b> clerical </b>and admin jobs they deal with, isn’t it?","WILLIAM:            That’s right.

They’ll probably start you as a receptionist, or <b>something like</b> that. So what’s important for that kind of job isn’t so much having <b>business skills</b> or knowing <b>lots of different</b> computer systems – it’s communication (Q3) that <b>really matters</b> – so you’d be fine there.

My name’s Erica Matthews, and I’m the owner of <b>Matthews Island</b> Holidays, a company <b>set up</b> by my parents. <b>Thank you for coming</b> to this presentation, in which I hope to interest you in what we have to offer.","We’re a small, family-run company, and we believe in the importance of the personal touch, so we don’t aim to compete with other companies on the number of customers. What we do is build on our many years’ experience – more than <b>almost any</b> other rail holiday company (Q11) – to ensure we provide perfect holidays in a <b>small number</b> of destinations, which we’ve got to know <b>extremely well</b>.","I’ll start with our six-day <b>Isle of Man</b> holiday. This is a fascinating island in the Irish Sea, with Wales to the south, England to the east, Scotland to the north and Northern Ireland to the west. Our holiday starts in Heysham, where your tour manager will meet you (Q12), then you’ll travel by <b>ferry to the Isle</b> of Man.","Some <b>people prefer</b> to fly from Luton instead, and <b>another popular</b> option is to go by train to Liverpool and take a<b> ferry </b>from there.","You have five nights in the hotel, and the price covers five breakfasts and dinners, and lunch on the <b>three days</b> when there are organised trips (Q13): <b>day four</b> is free, and <b><b>most people</b> have</b> lunch in a café or restaurant in Douglas.","The price of the holiday includes the <b>ferry to the Isle</b> of Man, all travel on the island, the hotel, and the meals I’ve mentioned. Incidentally, we <b>try to make</b> booking our holidays as simple and fair as possible, so unlike with many companies, the price is the same whether you book six <b>months in advance</b> or at the last minute, and there’s no supplement for <b>single rooms</b> in hotels.","If you make a booking then <b>need to change</b> the start date, for example because of illness, you’re welcome to change to an alternative date or a different tour, for a small administrative fee. (Q14)","——————————-","OK, so what does the holiday consist of? Well, on <b>day one</b> you’ll arrive in time for a short introduction by your tour manager, followed by dinner in the hotel. The <b>dining room</b> looks out at the river (Q15), close to where it flows into the harbour, and there’s usually plenty of activity going on.","On day two you’ll take the coach to the <b>small town</b> of Peel, on the way calling in at the Tynwald Exhibition. The <b>Isle of Man</b> isn’t part of the United Kingdom, and it <b>has its own</b> parliament, called Tynwald.","It’s claimed that this is the world’s oldest parliament that’s still functioning, and that it <b>dates back</b> to 979. However, the earliest surviving<b> reference </b>to it is from 1422 (Q16), so perhaps it isn’t quite as old as it claims!","Day three we have a trip to the mountain Snaefell. This begins with a leisurely ride along the<b> promenade </b>in Douglas in a horse-drawn tram. Then you board an electric train which takes you to the fishing village of Laxey.","From there it’s an eight-kilometre ride in the Snaefell Mountain Railway to the top (Q17). Lunch will be in the café, giving you <b>spectacular views</b> of the island.","<b>Day four</b> is free for you to explore, using the pass (Q18) which we’ll give you. So you won’t <b>have to pay</b> for travel on local transport, or for entrance to the island’s<b> heritage </b>sites.","Or you might <b>just want</b> to <b>take it easy</b> in Douglas and perhaps <b>do a little</b> light shopping.","The last full day, day five, is for <b>some people</b> the highlight of the holiday, with a ride on the steam (Q19) railway, from Douglas to Port Erin. After <b>some time</b> to explore, a coach will take you to the headlan. That overlooks the Calf of Man, a <b>small island</b> just off the coast.","From there you continue to Castletown, which used to be the capital (Q20) of the <b>Isle of Man</b>, and its<b> mediaeval </b>castle.","And on day six it’s back to the<b> ferry </b>– or the airport, if you flew to the island – and time to go home.","Now I’d <b>like to tell</b> you …","#3 <b>Personality traits</b> Transcript","The Part 3 <b>audio transcript</b> of <b>Personality traits</b> in Cambridge 15 <b>Listening Test</b> 1 is as follows:","RUTH:   Ed, how are you getting on with the reading for our presentation <b>next week</b>?","ED:         Well, OK, Ruth – but there’s so much of it.","RUTH:   I know, I hadn’t realised <b>birth order</b> was such a popular area of research.","ED:         But the stuff on <b>birth order</b> and personality is mostly unreliable. From what I’ve been reading a lot of claims about how your position in the family determines certain <b>personality traits</b> are just stereotypes, with no robust <b>evidence to support</b> them.","RUTH:   OK, but that’s an interesting point – we could start by outlining what previous <b><b>research has</b> shown</b>. There are studies <b>going back</b> over a <b>hundred years</b>.","ED:         Yeah – so we could <b>just <b>run through some</b></b> of the typical traits. Like the<b> consensus </b>seems to be that <b>oldest children</b> are generally less well-adjusted. Because they <b>never get</b> over the arrival of a younger sibling.","RUTH:   Right, but on a positive note, <b>some studies</b> claimed that they were thought to be good a nurturing – certainly in the past when <b>people had</b> large families they would <b>have been expected</b> to look after the younger ones. (Q21)","ED:         There isn’t such a <b>clear picture</b> for middle children – but one trait that a lot of the studies mention is that they are <b>easier to get</b> on with than older or <b>younger siblings</b>.","RUTH:   Generally eager to please and helpful (Q22) – although that’s certainly not <b>accurate as far</b> as my family goes – my middle brother was a nightmare – always causing fights and<b> envious </b>of whatever I had.","ED:         As I said – none of this seems to relate to my <b>own experience</b>. I’m the youngest in my family and I don’t recognise myself in any of the studies I’ve read about. I’m supposed to have been a<b> sociable </b>and confident child who made friends easily (Q23) – but I was actually<b> terribly </b>shy.","RUTH:   Really? That’s funny. There have been hundreds of studies on twins but mostly about nurture versus nature…","ED:         There was one on personality, which said that a twin is likely to be quite shy in<b> social </b>situations (Q24) because they <b>always have</b> their twin around to depend on for support.","RUTH:   My cousins were like that when they were small – they were only interested in <b>each other</b> and hard to engage with other kids. They’re fine now though.","ED:         Only <b>children have</b> <b>had a really</b> bad press – a lot of <b>studies have</b> branded them as<b> loners </b>who think the world<b> revolves </b>around them (Q25) because they’ve <b>never had</b> to fight for their parents’ attention.","RUTH:   That <b>does seem</b> a bit harsh. One category I hadn’t considered before was children with <b>much older</b> siblings – a couple of studies mentioned that these children <b>grow up</b> more quickly and are expected to do basic things for themselves – like getting dressed. (Q26)","ED:         I can see how that might be true – although I expect they’re sometimes the exact<b> opposite </b>– playing the baby role and<b> clamouring </b>for special treatment.","——————————–","RUTH:   What was the problem with most of these studies, <b>do you think</b>?","ED:         I think it was because in a lot of cases data was collected from <b>only one</b> sibling per family, who rated him or herself and his or her siblings at the <b>same time</b>.","RUTH:   Mmm. Some of the old research into the relationship between <b>birth order</b> and academic achievement <b>has been proved</b> to be accurate though. Performances in intelligence tests decline slightly from the eldest child to his or her <b>younger siblings</b>. This <b>has been proved</b> in lots of <b>recent studies</b>.","ED:         Yes. Although what many of them didn’t take into consideration was family size (Q27). The more siblings there are, the<b> likelier </b>the family is to have a low <b>socioeconomic status</b>. Which can also account for differences between siblings in <b>academic performance</b>.","RUTH:   The oldest boy might be given more<b> opportunities </b>than his younger sisters, for example.","ED:         Exactly.","RUTH:   But the <b>main reason</b> for the marginally higher <b>academic performance</b> of <b>oldest children</b> is quite surprising, I think. It’s not only that they benefit intellectually from extra attention at a <b>young age</b> – which is what I would <b>have expected</b>. It’s that they benefit from being teachers for their <b>younger siblings</b>, by<b> verbalising </b>processes. (Q28)","ED:         Right, and this gives them status and confidence, which again contribute, in a small way, to better performance.","So would you say sibling<b> rivalry </b>has been a useful thing for you?","RUTH:   I think so – my <b>younger brother</b> was incredibly annoying and we found a lot but I think this <b>has made</b> me a stronger person. I know how to defend myself (Q29/Q30). We <b>had some</b> terrible arguments and I would <b>have died</b> rather than apologise to him – but we had to <b>put up</b> with <b>each other</b> (Q29/Q30) and <b>most of the time</b> we co-existed<b> amicably </b>enough.","ED:         Yes, my situation was pretty similar. But I don’t <b>think having</b> two older brothers <b>made me</b> any less selfish – I was never prepared to <b>let me</b> brothers <b>use any</b> of my stuff …","RUTH:   That’s perfectly normal, whereas …","#4 The <b>Eucalyptus <b>tree in Australia</b></b> Transcript","The Part 4 <b>audio script</b> of The <b>Eucalyptus <b>tree in Australia</b></b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 1 is as follows:","Today I’m <b>going to talk</b> about the <b>eucalyptus tree</b>. This is a <b>very common</b> tree here in Australia, where it’s <b>also some</b>times called the gum tree. First I’m <b>going to talk</b> about why it’s important, then I’m going to describe <b>some problems</b> it faces at present.","Right, well the <b>eucalyptus tree</b> is an important tree for lots of reasons. For example, it gives shelter (Q31) to <b>creatures like</b> birds and bats, and these and <b>other species</b> also depend on it for food, particularly the<b> nectar </b>from its flowers. So it supports biodiversity. It’s useful to us humans too, because we can kill germs with a<b> disinfectant </b>made from oil (Q32) extracted from<b> eucalyptus </b>leaves.","The<b> eucalyptus </b>grows all over Australia and the trees can live for up to <b>four <b>hundred years</b></b>. So it’s alarming that all across the country, <b>numbers of eucalyptus</b> are falling because the trees are<b> dying </b>off prematurely. So what are the reasons for this?","<b>One <b>possible reason</b></b> is disease. As <b>far back</b> as the 1970s the trees started getting a <b>disease called</b> Mundulla Yellows. The trees’ leaves would gradually turn yellow, then the tree would die. It wasn’t until 2004 that they found the cause of the problem was lime, or calcium<b> hydroxide </b>to give it its proper chemical name, <b>used in the construction</b> of roads (Q33).","The<b> lime </b>was being <b>washed away</b> into the ground and affecting the roots of the <b><b>eucalyptus tree</b>s</b> nearby. What is was doing was preventing the trees from <b>sucking up</b> the iron they needed for healthy growth. When this was injected back into the affected trees, they immediately recovered.","But this problem only affected a <b>relatively small</b> <b>number of trees</b>. By 2000, huge <b>numbers of eucalyptus</b> were<b> dying </b>along Australia’s <b>East Coast</b>, of a <b>disease known</b> as Bell-miner Associated Die-back. The bell-miner is a bird, and the disease seems to be common where there are high populations of bell-miners.","Again it’s the leaves of the trees that are affected. What happens is that insects (Q34) settle on the leaves and eat their way round them, destroying them as they go, and at the <b>same time</b> they<b> secrete </b>a solution which has sugar in it. The bell-miner birds <b>really like</b> this solution, and in <b>order to get</b> as much as possible. They keep away other creatures that might <b>try to get</b> it. So these <b>birds and insects</b> flourish at the expense of <b>other species</b>. And eventually so much damage is done to the leaves that the tree dies.","————————–","But experts say that trees can <b>start looking</b> sick before <b>any sign</b> of Bell-miner Associated Die-back. So it looks as if the problem might <b>have another</b> explanation. <b>One possibility</b> is that it’s to do with the huge<b> bushfires </b>that we have in Australia. A theory proposed over 40 <b>years ago</b> be<b> ecologist </b>William Jackson is that the <b>frequency of bushfires</b> in a particular region affects the type of<b> vegetation </b>that grows there. If there are very <b>frequent bushfires</b> in a region, this <b>encourages grass</b> (Q35) to grow afterwards, while if the<b> bushfires </b>are <b>rather less</b> frequent, this results in the <b>growth of eucalyptus</b> forests.","So why is this? Why do fairly <b>frequent bushfires</b> actually support the <b>growth of eucalyptus</b>? Well, <b>one reason</b> is that the fire stops the growth of <b>other species</b> which would consume water (Q36) needed by <b><b>eucalyptus tree</b>s</b>. And there’s <b>another reason</b>.","If these other quick-growing<b> species </b>of bushes and plants are allowed to proliferate, they harm the<b> eucalyptus </b>in <b>another way</b>, by <b>affecting the composition</b> of the soil (Q37), and removing nutrients from it. So some<b> bushfires </b>are actually essential for the<b> eucalyptus </b>to <b>survive as long</b> as they are not too frequent. In fact there’s evidence that Australia’s<b> indigenous </b>people practised regular burning of bush land for <b>thousands of years</b> before the arrival of the Europeans.","But since <b>Europeans arrived</b> on the continent, the number of<b> bushfires </b>has been strictly controlled. Now scientists believe that this reduced <b>frequency of bushfires</b> to <b>low levels</b> had led to what’s known as ‘dry (Q38) rainforest’, which seems an odd name as usually we associate <b>tropical rainforest</b> with wet conditions.","And what’s special about this type of rainforest? Well, unlike <b>tropical rainforest</b> which is a rich ecosystem, this type of ecosystem is usually a simple (Q39) one. It <b>has very</b> thick, dense vegetation, but not much <b>variety of species</b>. The<b> vegetation </b>provides lots of shade, so <b>one species</b> that does find it ideal is the bell-miner bird, which builds its nests (Q40) in the undergrowth there. But again that’s not helpful for the <b>eucalyptus tree</b>."]},{"name":"GLS/15-2","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Festival information Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of <b>Festival information</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 2 is as follows:","TIM:       <b>Good morning</b>.

Could you <b>give <b>me <b>some information</b></b></b> about <b>next month</b>’s festival, please? My family and I will be staying in the town that week.","TIM:       Of course. Well it starts with a concert on the afternoon of the 17th.","JEAN:     Oh I heard about that. The<b> orchestra </b>and singers come from the USA, don’t they?","TIM:       They’re from Canada. They’re <b>very popular</b> over there. They’re going to perform a number of well-known pieces that will<b> appeal </b>to children as well as adults.","JEAN:     That <b>sounds good</b>. My whole family are interested in music.","TIM:       The next day, the 18th, there’s a performance by a ballet <b>company called</b> Eustatis. (Q1)","JEAN:     Sorry?","TIM:       The name is spelt E-U-S-T-A-T-I-S. They appeared in <b>last year</b>’s festival, and <b>went <b><b>down very</b> well</b></b>. Again, their programme is designed for <b>all ages</b>.","JEAN:     Good. I expect we’ll go to that. I hope there’s going to be a play during the festival, a comedy, ideally.","TIM:       You’re in luck! On the 19th and 20th a <b>local amateur</b> group are performing one written by a member of group. It’s called Jemima. That’ll be on in the <b>town hall</b>. They’ve already performed it <b><b>two or three</b> times</b>. I haven’t seen it myself, but the review (Q2) in the local paper was <b>very good</b>.","JEAN:     And is it suitable for children?","TIM:       Yes, in fact it’s aimed more at children than at adults, so both performances are in the afternoon.","JEAN:     And what about dance (Q3) ? Will there by any performances?","TIM:       Yes, also on the 20th, but in the evening. A professional company is putting on a show of modern pieces, with<b> electronic </b>music by young composers.","JEAN:     Uh-huh.","TIM:       The show is about how people communicate, or fail to communicate, with <b>each other</b>, so it’s got the <b>rather strange</b> name, Chat.

We’re <b>particularly interested</b> in cookery – you don’t <b>happen to have</b> a cookery workshop, do you?","TIM:       We <b>certainly do</b>. It’s going to focus on how to <b>make food</b> part of a healthy (Q5) lifestyle, and it’ll show that even sweet <b>things like</b> cakes can contain <b>much less</b> sugar than they usually do.","JEAN:     That might be worth going to. We’re trying to encourage our children to cook.","TIM:       Another workshop is just for children, and that’s on creating<b> posters </b>(Q6) to reflect the <b>history of the town</b>. The aim is to make children aware of how both the town and people’s lives <b>have <b>changed over the centuries</b></b>. The results will be exhibited in the <b>community centre</b>. Then the other workshop is in toy-making, and that’s for adults only.","JEAN:     Oh, why’s that?","TIM:       Because it involves<b> carpentry </b>– participants will be <b>making toys</b> out of wood (Q7), so there’ll be a lot of sharp<b> chisels </b>and other tools around.","JEAN:     It <b>makes sense</b> to keep children away from it.","TIM:       Exactly. <b>Now <b>let <b>me <b>tell you about some</b></b></b></b> of the <b>outdoor activities</b>.

Over to you, Mark.","MARK:","Thank you. I’m sure you’re <b>all familiar</b> with <b>Minster Park</b>. It’s been a feature of the city for well over a century, and has been the<b> responsibility </b>of the <b>city council</b> for most of that time. What perhaps isn’t so <b>well known</b> is the origin of the park: <b>un<b>like many</b></b> public parks that started in private ownership, as the garden of a large house, for instance, Minster was some waste land, which <b>people living</b> nearby started planting with flowers in 1892 (Q11). It was unclear who actually owned the land, and this wasn’t settled until 20 <b>years later</b>, when the council took possession of it.","You may <b><b>have no</b>ticed</b> the<b> statue </b>near one of the entrances. It’s of <b>Diane Gosforth</b>, who played a <b>key role</b> in the history of the park. Once the council <b>had become</b> the legal owner, it planned to sell the land for housing. Many <b>local people</b> (Q12) wanted it to remain a place that everyone could go to, to enjoy the <b>fresh air</b> and <b>natural environment</b> – remember the park is in a densely populated<b> residential </b>area. <b>Diane Gosforth</b> was one of those people, and she organised petitions and demonstrations (Q12), which eventually made the council <b>change its mind</b> about the future of the land.","Soon after this the <b><b>First World</b> War</b> broke out, in 1914, and most of the park was dug up and planted with vegetables (Q13), which were sold locally. At one stage the army considered taking in over for troop exercises and got as far as contacting the <b>city council</b>, then decided the park was <b>too small</b> to be of use. There were occasional public meetings during the war, in an <b>area that had</b> been retained as grass.","After the war, the park was turned back more or less to how it had been before 1914, and continued almost unchanged <b>until recently</b>. Plans for transforming it were <b>drawn up</b> at various times, <b>most recently</b> in 2013, though they were revised in 2015, before any work <b>had started</b>. The changes finally got going in 2016 (Q14), and were finished on schedule <b>last year</b>.","————————-","OK, <b>let <b>me tell</b></b> you about <b><b><b>some of the changes</b> that have</b> been made</b> – and <b>some things</b> that have been retained. If you look at this map, you’ll see the familiar outline of the park, with the river forming the northern boundary, and a gate in each of the other three walls. The<b> statue </b>of <b>Diane Gosforth</b> has been moved: it used to be close to the <b>south gate</b>, but it’s now immediately to the north of the lily pond, almost in the <b>centre of the park</b> (Q15), which <b>makes it much</b> more visible.","There’s a <b>new area</b> of wooden sculptures, which are on the river bank, where the path from the east gate makes a sharp bend. (Q16)","There are two areas that are particularly intended for children. The playground has been enlarged and improved, and that’s between the river and the <b>path that leads</b> from the pond to the river. (Q17)","Then there’s a new maze, a circular series of paths,<b> separated </b>by low hedges. That’s near the <b>west gate</b> – you go north from there towards the river and then turn left to reach it. (Q18)","There have been <b>tennis courts</b> in the park for many years, and they’ve been doubled, from four to eight. They’re still in the south-west corner of the park, where there’s a right-angle <b>bend in the path</b>. (Q19)","Something else I’d <b>like to mention</b> is the new fitness area. This is <b>right next</b> to the lily pond on the <b>same side</b> as the <b>west gate</b>. (Q20)","Now, as you’re all gardeners, I’m sure you’ll <b>like to hear</b> about the <b>plants that have</b> been chosen for the park.","#3 Cathy & <b>Graham novels</b> Transcript","The Part 3 <b>audio script</b> of Cathy & <b>Graham novels</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 2 is as follows:","CATHY:                 OK, Graham, so let’s check we both know what we’re supposed to be doing.","GRAHAM:            OK.","CATHY:                 So, for the university’s open day, we <b>have to plan</b> a display on British life and literature in the mid-19th century.","GRAHAM:            That’s right. But we’ll <b>have some</b> <b>people to help</b> us find the materials and set it up, remember – for the moment, we <b>just need</b> to plan it.","CATHY:                 Good. So have you gathered who’s expected to <b>come and see</b> the display? Is it for the people studying English, or students from other departments? I’m not clear about it.","GRAHAM:            Nor me. That was how it used to be, but it didn’t attract <b>many people</b>, so this year it’s <b>going to be part</b> of an open day, to raise the university’s profile. It’ll be<b> publicised </b>in the city, to <b>encourage people</b> to come and <b>find out something</b> of what does on here (Q21/Q22). And it’s included in the information that’s sent to people who are considering applying to study <b>here next</b> year. (Q21/Q22)","CATHY:                <b> Presumably </b>some current students and<b> lecturers </b>will come?","GRAHAM:            I would imagine so, but we’ve been told to<b> concentrate </b>on the other categories of people.","CATHY:                 Right. We don’t have to cover the <b>whole range</b> of 19th-century literature, do we?","GRAHAM:            No, it’s <b>entirely up</b> to us. I suggest just using Charles Dickens.","CATHY:                 That’s a <b>good idea</b>. <b><b>Most people</b> have</b> heard of him, and have probably read some of his novels, or seen films based on them (Q23/Q24), so that’s a good lead-in to life in his time.","GRAHAM:            Exactly. And his novels show the awful conditions that <b>most people</b> had to live in, don’t they: he wanted to shock people into <b><b>doing some</b>thing</b> about it. (Q23/Q24)","CATHY:                 Did he <b>do any</b> campaigning, other than writing?","GRAHAM:            Yes, he campaigned for education and <b>other social</b> reforms, and gave talks, but I’m inclined to ignore that and focus on the novels.","CATHY:                 Yes, I agree.","————————–","CATHY:                 OK, so now shall we think about a topic linked to each novel?","GRAHAM:            Yes. I’ve printed out a list of Dicken’s novels in the order they were published, in the hope you’d agree to focus on him!","CATHY:                 You’re lucky I did agree! Let’s <b>have a look</b>. OK, the first was The Pickwick Papers, published in 1836. It was <b>very successful</b> when it came out, wasn’t it, and was adapted for the theatre <b>straight away</b>.","GRAHAM:            There’s an interesting point, though, that there’s a character who keeps falling asleep, and that medical condition was named after the book – Pickwickian Syndrome. (Q25)","CATHY:                 Oh, so why don’t we use that as the topic, and include some<b> quotations </b>from the novel?","GRAHAM:            Right, Next is Oliver Twist. There’s a lot in the novel about poverty. But <b>maybe something</b> <b>less obvious</b> …","CATHY:                 Well Oliver is taught how to steal, isn’t he? We could use that to illustrate the fact that <b>very few</b> children went to school, particularly not poor children, so they<b> learnt </b>in <b>other ways</b>. (Q26)","GRAHAM:            <b>Good idea</b>. What’s next?","CATHY:                 Maybe Nicholas Nickleby. Actually he taught in a really cruel school, didn’t he?","GRAHAM:            That’s right. But there’s also the company of touring actors that Nicholas joins. We could <b><b>do some</b>thing</b> on theatres and other amusements of the time. (Q27) We don’t want only the bad things, do we?","CATHY:                 OK.","GRAHAM:            What about Martin Chuzzlewit? He goes to the USA, doesn’t he?","CATHY:                 Yes, and Dickens himself had been there a year before, and<b> drew </b>on his experience there in the novel. (Q28)","GRAHAM:            I wonder, though … The main theme is selfishness, so we could <b><b>do some</b>thing</b> on<b> social </b>justice? No, too general, let’s keep to your idea – I think it would <b>work well</b>.","CATHY:                 He wrote Bleak House next – that’s my favourite of his novels.","GRAHAM:            Yes, <b>mine too</b>. His<b> satire </b>of the legal system is pretty powerful.","CATHY:                 That’s true, but think about Esther, the heroine. As a child she lives with someone she doesn’t know is her aunt, who treats her very badly. Then she’s <b>very happy</b> living with her guardian, and he puts her in charge of the household. And at the end she gets married and her<b> guardian </b>gives her and her husband a house, where of course they’re <b>very happy</b>. (Q29)","GRAHAM:            Yes, I like that.","CATHY:                 What shall we take next? Little Dorrit? Old <b>Mr Dorrit</b> has been in a debtors’ prison for years …","GRAHAM:            So was Dicken’s father, wasn’t he?","CATHY:                 That’s right.","GRAHAM:            What about focusing on the part when <b>Mr Dorrit</b> inherits a fortune, and he starts<b> pretending </b>he’s always been rich? (Q30)","CATHY:                 <b>Good idea</b>.","GRAHAM:            OK, so next we <b>need to think</b> about what materials we want to illustrate each issue. That’s going to be <b>quite hard</b>.","#4 <b>Agricultural <b>programme in Mozambique</b></b> Transcript","The Part 4 <b>audio transcript</b> of <b>Agricultural <b>programme in Mozambique</b></b> in Cambridge 15 <b>Listening Test</b> 2 is as follows:","I’m going to report on a <b>case study</b> of a programme which has been <b>set up</b> to help rural populations in Mozambique, a largely agricultural country in South-East Africa.","The <b>programme worked</b> with three communities in Chicualacuala district, near the <b>Limpopo River</b>. This is a dry and<b> arid </b>region, with unpredictable rainfall. Because of this, <b>people in the area</b> were unable to support themselves through agriculture and instead they used the forest as a means of providing themselves with an income, mainly by selling charcoal. However, this was not a <b>sustainable way</b> of living in the <b>long term</b>, as they were rapidly using up this resource.","To support agriculture in this dry region, the programme focused primarily on <b>making use</b> of existing water resources from the <b>Limpopo River</b> by <b>setting up</b> systems of irrigation (Q31), which would provide a dependable <b>water supply</b> for crops and animals. The <b>programme worked</b> closely with the district government in <b>order to find</b> the <b>best way</b> of implementing this. The region <b>already had</b> one farmers’ association, and it was decided to <b>set up</b> two more of these. These associations <b>planned and carried</b> out activities including water management,<b> livestock </b>breeding and agriculture, and it was notable that in general, women (Q32) formed the majority of the workforce.","It was <b>decided that in order</b> to keep the crops safe from animals, both wild and domestic, special areas should be fenced off where the crops could be grown. The community was<b> responsible </b>for creating these fences, but the <b>programme <b>provided the necessary</b></b> wire (Q33) for making them.","Once the area had been fenced off, it could be cultivated. The land was dug, so that vegetables and<b> cereals </b>appropriate to the climate could be grown, and the <b>programme <b>provided the necessary</b></b> seeds (Q34) for this. The programme <b><b>also provide</b>d</b><b> pumps </b>so that water could be brought from the river in pipes to the fields. However, the<b> labour </b>was all provided by <b>local people</b>, and they <b><b>also provide</b>d</b> and <b>put up</b> the posts (Q35) that supported the fences around the fields.","———————-","Once the programme had been <b>set up</b>, its development was monitored carefully. The farmers were able to <b>grow enough</b> produce not just for their own needs, but also to sell. However, getting the produce to places where it could be marketed was sometimes a problem, as the farmers did not <b>have access</b> to transport (Q36), and this resulted in <b><b>large amount</b>s</b> of produce, especially vegetables, being spoiled. This problem was discussed with the farmers’ associations and it was <b>decided that in order</b> to prevent food from being spoiled, the farmers needed to <b>learn techniques</b> for its preservation. (Q37)","There was also an additional initiative that <b>had no</b>t been originally planned, but which became a <b>central feature</b> of the programme. This was when farmers started to dig holes for tanks in the fenced-off areas and to fill these with water and use them for breeding fish (Q38) – an important <b>source of protein</b>. After a time, another suggestion was made by <b>local people</b> which hadn’t been part of the programme’s original proposal, but which was also adopted later on. They <b>decided to try</b> <b>setting up</b> colonies of bees (Q39), which would provide honey both for their own consumption and to sell.","So what lessons can be learned from this programme? <b>First of all</b>, it tells us that in dry,<b> arid </b>regions, if there is access to a reliable source of water, there is great potential for the development of agriculture. In Chicualacuala, there was a marked improvement in agricultural production, which improved food security and benefited <b>local people</b> by providing them with both food and income. However, it’s important to set realistic timelines for each phase of the programme, especially for its design (Q40), as mistakes made at this stage may be hard to correct later on.","The programme demonstrates that<b> sustainable </b>development is possible in areas where …"]},{"name":"GLS/15-3","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Employment Agency Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of Employment Agency: Possible jobs in <b>Listening Test</b> 3 is as follows:","SALLY:   <b>Good morning</b>. <b>Thanks for coming</b> in to see us here at the agency, Joe.

For those of you that don’t <b>already know</b> – <b>Street Play</b> involves <b>local residents</b> closing off their street for a <b>few hours</b> so that <b>children have</b> a <b>chance to play</b> in the street safely. She started it in her own street, <b>Beechwood Road</b>, and the idea caught on, and there are now <b>Street <b>Play Scheme</b></b>s all over the city. So when did you actually start the scheme, Alice?","ALICE:","Well, I <b>first had</b> the idea when my oldest child was still a toddler, so that’s about <b>six years</b> ago now – but it <b>took at least</b> two <b>years of campaigning</b> before we were <b>actually able</b> to make it happen. So the scheme’s been up and running for <b>three years</b> now (Q11). We’d love to be able to close our road for longer – for the whole weekend, from Saturday <b>morning until</b> Sunday evening, for example. At the moment it’s just <b>once a week</b> (Q12). But when we started it was <b>only once</b> a month. But we’re working on it.","PRESENTER:","So what actually happens when <b>Beechwood Road</b> is closed?","ALICE:","We have volunteer wardens, mostly parents but some elderly<b> residents </b>too, who block off our road at either end (Q13). The council <b>have provided</b> special signs but there’s always a volunteer there to explain what’s happening to any motorists.","Now I should explain that the road isn’t completely closed to cars. But only residents’ cars are allowed. If <b><b>people really</b> need</b> to get in or out of <b>Beechwood Road</b>, it’s not a problem – as long as they drive at under 20 <b><b>kilometres per</b> hour</b> (Q14). But <b>most people</b> just decide not to <b>use their cars</b> during this time, or they park in another street. The<b> wardens </b>are only there to stop through traffic.","PRESENTER:","So can anyone apply to <b>get involved</b> in <b>Street Play</b>?","ALICE:","Absolutely – we <b>want to include</b> all kids in the city – especially those who live on <b>busy roads</b> (Q15). It’s here that demand is greatest. Obviously, there isn’t such demand in wealthier areas where the <b>children have</b> access to parks or large gardens – or in the<b> suburbs </b>where there are usually more places for children to play outside.","I’d recommend that anyone listening who likes the idea should <b>just give</b> it a go. And that’s not <b>just parents</b>. There are always a few who complain but they’re a tiny minority. On the whole everyone is very supportive and say they’re <b>very happy</b> to see children out on the street (Q16) – even if it does <b>get quite</b> noisy.","——————-","ALICE:","There have been so many benefits of <b>Street Play</b> for the kids. Parents really <b>like the fact</b> that the kids are getting <b>fresh air</b> instead of sitting staring at a computer screen, even if they’re not <b>doing anything</b> particularly energetic. And of course it’s great that kids can play with their friends outside without being<b> supervised </b>by their parents – but for me the biggest advantage is that kids develop confidence in themselves to be outside without their parents (Q17/Q18). The other really fantastic thing is that children <b>get to know</b> the adults in the street – it’s like <b>having a big</b> extended family (Q17/Q18).","PRESENTER:","It <b><b>certainly do</b>es</b> <b>have a lot</b> of benefits. I want to <b>move on now</b> and ask you about a related project in <b>King Street</b>.","ALICE:","Right. Well this was an experiment I was involved in where <b>local residents</b> <b>decided to try</b> and reduce the traffic along <b>King Street</b>, which is the busiest <b>main road</b> in our area, by persuading people not to <b>use their cars</b> for <b>one day</b>. We thought about <b>making people</b> pay more for parking – but we decided that would be really unpopular – so instead we just stopped people from parking on <b>King Street</b> but left the other <b><b>car park</b>s</b> open.","It was surprising how much of a difference all this made. As we’d predicted, <b>air quality</b> was significantly better but what I hadn’t expected was how much quieter it would be (Q19/Q20) – even with the buses still running. Of course everyone <b>said they felt</b> safer but we were actually amazed that sales in the shops <b>went up</b> considerably that day (Q19/Q20) – we thought there’d be <b>fewer people</b> out shopping – not more.","PRESENTER:","That’s <b>really interesting</b> so the fact that …","#3 <b>Hazel <b>newspaper articles</b></b> Transcript","The Part 3 <b>audio transcript</b> of <b>Hazel <b>newspaper articles</b></b> in Cambridge 15 <b>Listening Test</b> 3 is as follows:","HAZEL:  Tom, could I ask you for <b>some advice</b>, please?","TOM:     Yes of course, if you think I can help. What’s it about?","HAZEL:  It’s my first media studies assignment, and I’m not sure how to go about it. You must <b>have done</b> it <b>last year</b>.","TOM:     Is that the one comparing the coverage of a particular story in a range of newspapers?","HAZEL:  That’s right.","TOM:     <b>Oh yes</b>, I really enjoyed writing it.","HAZEL:  So what <b>sort of thing</b>s <b>do I need</b> to compare?","TOM:     Well, there are several things. For example, there’s the question of which page (Q21) of the newspaper the item appears on.","HAZEL:  You mean, because there’s a <b>big difference</b> between having it on the front page and the bottom of page ten, for instance?","TOM:     Exactly. And that shows how important the editor thinks the story is. Then there’s the size (Q22) – how many column inches the story is given, how many columns it spreads over.","HAZEL:  And I suppose that includes the headline.","TOM:     It <b><b>certainly do</b>es</b>. It’s all part of attracting the reader’s attention.","HAZEL:  What about graphics (Q23) – whether there’s anything visual in addition to the text?","TOM:     Yes, you <b>need to consider</b> those, too, because they can <b>have a big</b> effect on the reader’s understanding of the story – sometimes a bigger effect than the text itself. Then you’ll <b>need to look</b> at how the item is put together: what structure (Q24) is it given? <b>Bear in mind</b> that not <b>many people</b> read beyond the first paragraph, so what has the<b> journalist </b>put at the beginning? And if, say, three are conflicting opinions about something, does one appear near the end, where people probably won’t read it?","HAZEL:  And newspapers sometimes give <b>wrong or misleading</b> information, don’t they?","Either deliberately or by accident. Should I be looking at that, too?","TOM:     Yes, if you can. Compare what’s in different versions, and as far as possible, try and work out what’s true and what isn’t. And that relates to a very <b>important point</b>: what’s the writer’s purpose (Q25), or at least the <b>most important</b> one, if they <b>have several</b>. It may seem to be to inform the public, but often it’s that they want to create fear, or controversy, or to <b>make some</b>body look ridiculous.","HAZEL:  Gosh, I <b>see what you mean</b>. And I suppose the writer may make assumptions (Q26) about the reader.","TOM:     That’s right – about their knowledge of the subject, their attitudes, and their level of education, which means writing so that the readers understand without feeling patronised. All of that will make a difference.","———————-","HAZEL:  Does it matter what type of story I write about?","TOM:     No – national or international politics, the arts … Anything, as long as it’s covered in <b>two or three</b> newspaper. <b>Though of course</b> it’ll be easier and more fun if it’s something you’re interested in and <b>know something</b> about.","HAZEL:  And on that basis a national news item would be worth analysing – I’m quite keen on politics, so I’ll try and find a suitable topic (Q27). What <b>did you choose</b> for your analysis, Tom?","TOM:     I was interested in how newspapers express their opinions explicitly, so I wanted to compare editorials in different papers, but when I <b>started looking</b>. I couldn’t find two on the same topic (Q28) that I felt like analysing.","HAZEL:  In that case, I won’t even bother to look (Q28).","TOM:     So in the end I chose a human interest story – a<b> terribly </b>emotional story about a <b>young girl</b> who was very ill, and <b><b>lots of other</b> people</b> – mostly strangers – raised money so she could <b>go abroad</b> for treatment. Actually, I was surprised – some papers just wrote about how wonderful everyone was, but others considered the broader picture, like why treatment wasn’t available here.","HAZEL:  Hmm, I <b>usually find</b> <b>stories like</b> that raise quite strong feelings in me! I’ll avoid that (Q29). Perhaps I’ll choose an arts topic (Q30), like different reviews of a film, or something about funding for the arts – I’ll think about that.","TOM:     Yes, that might be interesting.","HAZEL:  OK, well <b>thanks a lot</b> for your help, Tom. It’s been <b>really useful</b>.","TOM:     You’re welcome. <b>Good luck</b> with the assignment, Hazel.","#4 <b><b>Early <b>history of keeping</b></b> clean</b> Transcript","The Part 4 <b>audio script</b> of <b><b>Early <b>history of keeping</b></b> clean</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 3 is as follows:","Nowadays, we <b>use different</b> products for personal cleanliness, laundry, dishwashing and household cleaning, but this is <b>very much</b> a 20th-century development.","The origins of<b> cleanliness </b><b>date back</b> to <b>prehistoric times</b>. Since water is essential for life, the earliest <b>people lived</b> near water and knew something about its<b> cleansing </b>properties – at least that it<b> rinsed </b>mud off (Q31) their hands.","During the<b> excavation </b>of ancient Babylon, evidence was found that<b> soapmaking </b>was known as early as 2800 BC. Archaeologists discovered<b> cylinders </b>made of clay (Q32), with<b> inscriptions </b>on them saying that fats were boiled with askes. This is a method of making soap, though there’s no<b> reference </b>to the purpose of this material.","The early Greeks bathed for aesthetic reasons and apparently didn’t use soap. Instead, they cleaned their bodies with blocks of sand,<b> pumice </b>and ashes, then<b> anointed </b>themselves with oil, and<b> scraped </b>off the oil and dirt with a metal instrument known as a strigil (Q33). They <b><b>also use</b>d</b> oil mixed with ashes. Clothes were washed without soap in streams.","The ancient Germans and Gauls are also credited with discovering how to make a substance called ‘soap’, made of melted <b>animal fat</b> and ashes. They used this mixture to<b> tint </b>their hair red (Q34).","Soap got its name, according to an <b>ancient Roman</b> legend, from Mount Sapo, where animals were sacrificed, leaving deposits of <b>animal fat</b>. Rain washed these deposits, along with wood ashes, down into the clay soil along the River Tiber. Women found that this mixture greatly reduced the <b>effort required</b> to wash their clothes.","As Roman civilisation advance, so did bathing. The first of the famous Roman baths, supplied with water from their<b> aqueducts </b>(Q35). It was built around 312 BC. The baths were luxurious, and bathing became <b>very popular</b>. And by the <b>second century</b> AD, the Greek<b> physician </b>Galen recommended soap for both<b> medicinal </b>and cleaning purposes.","————————–","After the fall of Rome in 467 AD and the resulting decline in bathing habits, much of Europe felt the impact of filth on public health. This lack of personal<b> cleanliness </b>and related<b> unsanitary </b>living conditions were major factors in the outbreaks of disease (Q36) in the <b>Middle Ages</b>, and especially the Black Death of the 14th century.","Nevertheless, <b>soapmaking became</b> an established<b> craft </b>in Europe, and associations of<b> soapmakers </b>guarded their trade secrets closely. Vegetable and animal oils were used with ashes of plants, along with perfume, apparently for the <b>first time</b> (Q37). Gradually more varieties of soap <b>became available</b> for<b> shaving </b>and shampooing, as well as bathing and laundering.","<b>A </b> major step toward large-scale commercial<b> soapmaking </b>occurred in 1791, when a French chemist, Nicholas Leblanc,<b> patented </b>a process for turning salt into <b>soda ash</b> (Q38), or<b> sodium </b>carbonate. <b>Soda ash</b> is the<b> alkali </b>obtained from ashes. That combines with fat to form soap. The Leblanc process yielded quantities of good-quality,<b> inexpensive </b><b>soda ash</b>.","Modern<b> soapmaking </b>was born some 20 <b>years later</b>, in the early 19th century, with the discovery by Michel Eugène Chevreul, another French chemist, of the chemical nature and relationship of fats,<b> glycerine </b>and fatty acids. His studies established the basis for both fat and soap chemistry, and <b>soapmaking became</b> a science (Q39). Further developments during the 19th century made it easier and <b>cheaper to manufacture</b> soap.","Until the 19th century, soap was regarded as a luxury item, and was heavily taxed in <b>several countries</b>. As it became more readily available, it became an everyday necessity, a development that was reinforced when the high tax was removed (Q40). Soap was then something <b>ordinary people</b> could afford, and<b> cleanliness </b>standards improved.","With this widespread use came the development of<b> milder </b>soaps for bathing and soaps for use in the washing machines that were available to consumers by the turn of the 20th century."]},{"name":"GLS/15-4","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Customer Satisfaction Survey Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of <b><b>Customer Satisfaction</b> Survey</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 4 is as follows:","MAN:                    Hello.

So if you could <b>just take</b> a <b>look at the map</b> I handed out, let’s begin with a general overview. So the basic arrangement of the park hasn’t changed – it <b>still has</b> two gates, north and south, and a lake in the middle.","The café continues to serve an assortment of <b>drinks and snacks</b> and is still in the same place, looking out over the lake and next to the <b>old museum</b>. (Q11)","We’re<b> hoping </b>to change the location of the toilets, and bring them nearer to the <b>centre of the park</b> as they’re a bit out of the way at present, near the <b>adventure playground</b>, in the corner of your map.

Before we plan our <b>presentation about refrigeration</b>, let’s discuss what we’ve discovered so far.","JACK:     Fine, Annie. Though I have to admit I haven’t done much research yet.","ANNIE:  Nor me. But I found an interesting article about icehouses. I’d been some 18th- and 19th-century ones here in the UK, so I knew they were often built in a<b> shady </b>area or underground, close to lakes that might freeze in the winter. But I didn’t realise that<b> insulating </b>the blocks with<b> straw </b>or<b> sawdust </b>meant they didn’t melt for months (Q21). The <b><b>ancient Roman</b>s</b> had refrigeration, too.","JACK:     I didn’t know that.","ANNIE:  Yes,<b> pits </b>were dug in the ground, and snow was imported from the mountains – <b>even though</b> they were at <b>quite a distance</b>. The snow was stored in the pits. Ice formed at the bottom of it. Both the ice and the snow were then sold (Q22). The ice cost more than the snow and my guess is that only the wealthy members of society could afford it.","JACK:     I wouldn’t be surprised. I also <b>came across</b> an article about modern <b>domestic fridges</b>.","ANNIE:  You have to wonder what happens when people <b>get rid</b> of old ones.","JACK:     You mean because the gases in them are harmful for the environment?","ANNIE:  Exactly. At least these are now plenty of organisations that will recycle most of the components safety, but of course some <b>people just</b><b> dump </b>old<b> fridges </b>in the countryside. (Q23)","JACK:     It’s <b>hard to see</b> how they can be stopped unfortunately (Q23). In the UK we <b>get rid</b> of three <b>million a year</b> altogether!","ANNIE:  That sounds a lot, especially because<b> fridges </b><b>hardly ever</b> break down.","JACK:     That’s right. In this country we keep <b>domestic fridges</b> for 11 years on average, and a lot last for 20 or more. So if you divide the cost by the <b>number of years</b> you can use a fridge, they’re not expensive, <b>compared with some</b> household appliances. (Q24)","ANNIE:  True. I suppose manufactures <b>encourage people</b> to spend more by making them different colours and designs. I’m sure when my parents bought their first<b> fridge </b>they had <b>hardly any</b> choice!","JACK:     Yes, there’s been quite a change.","———————–","JACK:     Right, let’s <b>make a list</b> of topics to cover in our presentation, and decide who’s <b>going to do</b> more research on them. Then later, we can get together and plan the <b>next step</b>.","ANNIE:  OK. How about starting with how useful<b> refrigeration </b>is, and the range of goods that are<b> refrigerated </b>(Q25) nowadays? Because of course it’s not just food and drinks.","JACK:     No, I suppose flowers and medicines are refrigerated, too.","ANNIE:  And computers. I could do that (Q26), unless you particularly want to.","JACK:     No, that’s fine by me. What about the effects of<b> refrigeration </b>on people’s health (Q26)? After all, some of the chemicals used in the 19th century were pretty harmful, but there have been <b>lots of benefits</b> too, like <b>always have</b> access to <b>fresh food</b>. Do you fancy dealing with that?","ANNIE:  I’m no<b> terribly </b>keen, to be honest.","JACK:     Nor me.

But you own me, Jack.","What about the effects on food producers, like farmers in poorer countries being able to export their produce to <b>developed countries</b>? Something for you, maybe?","JACK:     I don’t mind. It should be <b>quite interesting</b>.","ANNIE:  I think we should also look at how<b> refrigeration </b><b>has helped</b> whole cities (Q28) – like <b>Las Vegas</b>, which couldn’t exist without<b> refrigeration </b>because it’s in the middle of a desert.","JACK:     Right. I had a <b>quick look</b> at an economics book in the library that’s got a chapter about this <b>sort of thing</b>. I could give you the title, if you <b>want to do</b> this section.","ANNIE:  Not particularly, to be honest. I find economics books pretty heavy going, as a rule.","JACK:     OK, leave it to me, then.","ANNIE:  Thanks. Then there’s transport, and the difference that<b> refrigerated </b>trucks (Q29) <b>have made</b>. I wouldn’t mind having a go at that.","JACK:     Don’t forget trains, too. I read something about milk and butter being transported in<b> refrigerated </b>railroad cars in the USA, right back in the 1840s.","ANNIE:  I hadn’t thought of trains. Thanks.","JACK:     Shall we have a <b>separate section</b> on <b>domestic fridges</b> (Q30)? After all, they’re something everyone’s familiar with.","ANNIE:  What about splitting it into two? You could investigate 19th- and 20th-century fridges, and I’ll<b> concentrate </b>on what’s available these days, and how manufacturers<b> differentiate </b>their products from those of their competitors.","JACK:     OK, that’d suit me.","#4 How <b><b><b><b>industrial revolution</b> affected</b> life</b> in Britain</b> Transcript","The Part 4 <b>audio script</b> of How <b><b><b><b>industrial revolution</b> affected</b> life</b> in Britain</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 4 is as follows:","Hi everyone, in this session I’ll be presenting my research about the<b> social </b>history of Britain <b><b>during the Industrial</b> Revolution</b>. This was a time that saw the beginning of a new phenomenon;<b> consumerism </b>– where <b>buying and selling</b> goods became a major part of <b>ordinary people</b>’s lives.","In fact, it was in the 19th century that the quantity and quality of people’s possessions was used as an<b> indication </b>of the wealth (Q31) of the country. Before this, the <b>vast majority</b> of <b>people had</b> <b>very few</b> possessions, but all that was changed by the <b>Industrial Revolution</b>. This was the<b> era </b>from the mid-18th to the late 19th century, when improvements in how goods were made as well as in technology (Q32) triggered massive<b> social </b>changes that transformed life for <b>just about everybody</b> in <b>several key</b> areas.","First let’s look at manufacturing. When it comes to manufacturing, we tend to think of the <b>Industrial Revolution</b> in images of steam engines and coal. And it’s true that the <b>Industrial Revolution</b> couldn’t <b>have <b>taken place</b></b> at all if it weren’t for these new <b>sources of power</b> (Q33). They marked an important shift away from the traditional<b> watermills </b>and<b> windmills </b>that had<b> dominated </b>before this. The <b>most advanced</b> industry for much of the 19th century was<b> textiles </b>(Q34).","Before the <b>Industrial Revolution</b>, <b>most people</b> <b>made goods</b> to sell in small workshops, <b>often in their own</b> homes. But enormous new machines (Q35) were now being created that could produce the goods faster and on a larger scale, and these required a lot more space. So large factories were built, replacing the workshops, and forcing workers to <b>travel to work</b>. In fact, <b><b>large number</b>s</b> of people migrated from villages into towns as a result.","———————–","As well as manufacturing, there were <b>new technologies</b> in transport, contributing to the growth of consumerism. The horse-drawn<b> stagecoaches </b>and carts of the 18th century, which carried very <b>few people</b> and good, and travelled slowly along poorly surfaced roads, were <b>gradually replaced</b> by the<b> numerous </b>canals that were constructed. These were <b>particularly important</b> for the transportation of goods.","The canals gradually <b>fell out of use</b>, though, as railways were developed, becoming the <b>main way</b> of moving goods and people from <b>one end</b> of the country to the other. And the goods they moved weren’t just coal, iron, clothes, and so on – significantly, they included newspapers (Q36), which meant that <b>thousands of people</b> were not only more<b> knowledgeable </b>about what was going on in the country, but could <b>also read</b> about what was available in the shops. And that encouraged them to buy more. so faster forms of transport resulted in distribution becoming far more efficient – goods could now be sold all over the country, <b>instead of just</b> in the local (Q37) market.","The third main area that saw changes that contributed to<b> consumerism </b>was retailing. The number and quality of shops grew rapidly, and in particular, small shops suffered as customers<b> flocked </b>to the <b>growing number</b> of <b>department stores</b> – a form of retailing that was new in the 19th century. The<b> entrepreneurs </b>who opened these found <b>new ways</b> to stock them with goods, and to attract customers: for instance, improved lighting (Q38) inside greatly increased the visibility of the goods for sale. Another development that <b>made goods</b> more visible from outside resulted from the use of plate glass, which <b>made it possible</b> for windows (Q39) to be <b>much larger</b> than previously. <b>New ways</b> of promoting goods were introduced, too. Previously, the focus had been on informing <b>potential customers</b> about the availability of goods; now there was an<b> explosion </b>in advertising (Q40) trying to <b>persuade people</b> to go shopping.","Flanders claims that <b>one of the great</b> effects of the <b>Industrial Revolution</b> was that it created choice. <b>All sorts</b> of things that had previously been luxuries – from sugar to<b> cutlery </b>– became conveniences, and before long they’d turned into necessities: life without sugar or<b> cutlery </b>was unimaginable. <b>Rather like</b> <b>mobile phones</b> these days!"]},{"name":"GLS/16-1","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Children’s Engineering Workshops Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of Children’s <b>Engineering Workshops</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 1 is as follows:","SARAH:     Hello.

The younger one’s Lydia, she’s four – <b>do you take</b> children as young as that?","SARAH:     Yes, our <b>Tiny Engineers</b> workshop is for four to five-year-olds.","FATHER:     What <b>sorts of activities</b> <b>do they do</b>?","SARAH:     <b>All sorts</b>. For example, they <b>work together</b> to design a special cover that <b>goes round</b> an egg (Q1), so that when it’s inside they can drop it from a height and it doesn’t break. Well, sometimes it does break but that’s part of the fun!","FATHER:     Right. And Lydia loves building things. Is there any opportunity for her to do that?","SARAH:     Well, they <b>have a competition</b> to see who can make the highest tower (Q2). You’d be amazed how high they can go.","FATHER:     Right.","SARAH:     But they’re learning <b>all the time</b> as <b>well as having</b> fun. For example, <b>one thing</b> they do is to design and build a car (Q3) that’s attached to a balloon, and the force of the air in that actually powers the car and makes it move along.

That’s for children from six to eight.","FATHER:     And do they <b>do the same</b> <b>sorts of activities</b>?","SARAH:     Some are the same, but a bit more advanced. So they work out how to build model vehicles, <b>things like</b> cars and trucks, but also how to construct animals (Q4) <b>using the same</b> sorts of material and technique, and then they learn how they can program them and make them move.","FATHER:     So they learn a bit of coding?","SARAH:     They do. They pick it up <b>really quickly</b>. We’re there to help if they need it, but they learn from <b>one another</b> too.","FATHER:     Right. And <b>do they have</b> competition too?","SARAH:     Yes, with the Junior Engineers, it’s to use<b> recycled </b><b>materials like</b> card and wood to build a bridge (Q5), and the longest one gets a prize.","FATHER:     That sounds fun. I wouldn’t mind doing that myself!","SARAH:     Then they <b><b>have some</b>thing</b> a bit different, which is to think up an idea for a five-minute movie (Q6) and then film it, using special animation software. You’d be amazed what they <b>come up</b> with.","FATHER:     And of course, that’s something they can put on their phone and <b>take home</b> to show all their friends.","SARAH:     Exactly. And then they also build a robot in the shape of a human, and they decorate (Q7) it and program it so that it can move its arms and legs.","FATHER:     Perfect.

The classes are held in the morning from ten to eleven.","FATHER:     OK. That’s better for me actually. And what about the location?

Thank you for choosing us for your <b>two weeks</b> of <b>work experience</b>. My name is Julia Simmons, and <b>since the beginning</b> of this year I’ve been the managing director.","Stevenson’s is quite an old company. <b>Like me</b>, the founder, Ronald Stevenson, went into the<b> steel </b>industry when he <b>left school</b> – that was in 1923. He <b>set up</b> this company when he finished his apprenticeship, in 1926 (Q11), although he actually started making plans <b>two years</b> earlier, in 1924. He was a very determined <b>young man</b>!","Stevenson’s long-term plan was to manufacture components for the machine tools industry – although in fact that never came about – and for the automotive industry, that is, <b>cars and lorries</b>. However, there was a delay of <b>five years</b> before that happened, because shortly before the company went into production, Stevenson was <b>given the opportunity</b> to make goods for hospitals and other players in the healthcare industry, so that’s what we did for the first <b>five years</b> (Q12).","Over the years, we’ve expanded the premises considerably – we were lucky that the site is <b>big enough</b>, so <b>moving to a new</b> location <b>has never</b> been necessary (Q13). However, the layout is far from ideal for modern<b> machinery </b>and production methods, so we intend to carry out <b>major refurbishment</b> of this site (Q13) over the next <b>five years</b>.","I’d better <b><b>give you some</b> idea</b> of what you’ll be doing during your <b>two weeks</b> with us, so you know what to expect. Most mornings you’ll have a presentation from one of the managers (Q14), to learn about their department, starting this morning with research and development. And you’ll all <b>spend some</b> <b>time in each</b> department, observing what’s going on and talking to people – as long as you don’t stop them from doing their <b>work altogether</b>! In the past, a teacher from your <b>school has</b> come in at the <b>end of each</b> week to find out how the group were getting on, but your school isn’t able to arrange that this year.","————————-","OK, now I’ll briefly help you to<b> orientate </b>yourselves around the site. As you can see, we’re in the reception area, which we <b>try to make</b> attractive and welcoming to visitors. There’s a corridor <b>running left</b> from here, and if you go along that, the door facing you at the end is the entrance to the coffee room. This <b><b>looks out onto the main</b> road</b> on <b>one side</b>, and <b>some trees</b> on the other (Q15), and that’ll be where you meet <b>each morning</b>.","The factory is the very big room on the <b>far side</b> of the site. Next to it is the warehouse, which can be accessed by<b> lorries </b>going up the road to the turning area at the end. You can get to the warehouse by crossing to the <b>far side</b> of the courtyard, and then the door is on your right (Q16).","Somewhere you’ll be keen to find is the staff canteen. This is <b>right next</b> to reception (Q17). I can confidently say that the food’s <b>very good</b>, but the view isn’t. The windows on <b>one side</b> look onto a corridor and courtyard, which aren’t <b>very attractive</b> at all, and on the other onto the access road, which isn’t <b>much better</b>.","You’ll be using the <b>meeting room</b> quite often, and you’ll find it by walking along the corridor to the left of the courtyard, and continuing along it to the end. The <b>meeting room</b> is the last one on the right (Q18), and I’m afraid there’s <b>no natural</b> daylight in the room.","Then you’ll <b>need to know</b> where some of the offices are. The <b>human <b>resources department</b></b> is all the front of this building, so you head to the left along the corridor from reception, and it’s the second <b>room you come</b> to. It <b><b>looks out onto the main</b> road</b> (Q19).","And finally, the boardroom (Q20), where you’ll be meeting sometimes. That <b>has quite</b> a pleasant view, as it looks out on to the trees. Go along the corridor past the courtyard, right to the end. The boardroom is on the left, next to the factory.","OK, now are there <b>any questions</b> before we …","#3 Part 3 <b>Listening Test</b> 1 Transcript","The Part 3 <b>audio <b>transcript in Cambridge</b></b> 16 <b>Listening Test</b> 1 is as follows:","JESS:     How are you getting on with your art project, Tom?","TOM:     OK. Like, they gave us the theme of birds to base our project on, and I’m not <b>really all</b> that interested in wildlife. But I’m starting to get into it. I’ve <b>pretty well</b> finished the<b> introductory </b>stage.","JESS:     So have I. When they gave us all those handouts with details of books and websites to look at (Q21/Q22), I was really put off, but the more I read, the more interested I got.","TOM:     <b>Me too</b>. I found I could research so many <b>different aspects</b> of birds in art – colour, movement, texture. So I was <b>looking forward</b> to the Bird Park visit.","JESS:     What a letdown! It<b> poured </b>with rain and we hardly saw a single bird. <b>Much less</b> use than the trip to the <b>Natural History</b> Museum (Q21/Q22).","TOM:     Yeah, I liked all the stuff about evolution there. The workshop sessions with Dr Fletcher were good too, especially the brainstorming sessions.","JESS:     I missed those because I was ill. I wish we could’ve seen the projects <b>last year</b>’s <b>students did</b>.","TOM:     Mm. I suppose they want us to do our own thing, not copy.","JESS:     Have you drafted your proposal yet?","TOM:     Yes, but I haven’t handed it in. I need to amend some parts. I’ve realised the notes from my research are <b>almost all</b> just descriptions, I haven’t actually evaluated anything. So I’ll have to fix that (Q23/Q24).","JESS:     Oh, I didn’t know we <b>had to do</b> that. I’ll have to <b>look at that too</b>. Did you do a timeline for the project?","TOM:     Yes, and a mind map.","JESS:     Yeah, so did I. I quite enjoyed that. But it was hard having to explain the basis for my decisions in my <b>action plan</b>.","TOM:     What?","JESS:     You know, give a rationale.","TOM:     I didn’t realise we <b>had to do</b> that. OK, I can add it now. And I’ve done the video diary presentation, and worked out what I want my outcome to be in the project.","JESS:     <b><b>Someone told</b> me</b> it’s best not to be too precise about your actual outcome (Q23/Q24) at this stage, so you have more scope to explore your ideas later on. So I’m <b>going to do</b> back to my proposal to make it a bit more vague.","TOM:     Really? OK, I’ll change that too then.","——————————","TOM:     <b>One part</b> of the project, I’m unsure about is where we choose <b>some painting</b>s of birds and say what they mean to us. Like, I chose a painting of a falcon by Landseer. I like it because the bird’s standing there with his head turned to <b>one side</b>, but he seems to be staring<b> straight </b>at you. But I can’t just say it’s a bit scary, can I?","JESS:     You could talk about the possible danger suggested by the bird’s look (Q25).","TOM:     Oh, OK.","JESS:     There’s a picture of a fish<b> hawk </b>by Audubon I like. It’s<b> swooping </b>over the water with a fish in its talons, and with <b>great black</b> wings which <b>take up</b> most of the picture.","TOM:     So you could discuss it in relation to predators and food chains?","JESS:     Well actually I think I’ll<b> concentrate </b>on the impression of rapid motion it gives. (Q26)","TOM:     Right.","JESS:     <b>Do you know</b> that picture of a<b> kingfisher </b>by van Gosh – it’s<b> perching </b>on a<b> reed </b>growing near a stream.","TOM:     Yes, it’s got these beautiful blue and red and black shades.","JESS:     Mm hm. I’ve actually chosen it because I saw a real<b> kingfisher </b>once when I was litter, I was out walking with my grandfather (Q27), and I’ve <b>never forgotten</b> it.","TOM:     So we can use a personal link?","JESS:     Sure.","TOM:     OK. There’s a<b> portrait </b>called William Wells. I can’t remember the artist but it’s a middle-aged man who’s just shot a bird. And his expression, and the way he’s holding the bird in his hand suggests he’s not sure about what he’s done. To me it’s about how<b> ambiguous </b>people are in the way they<b> exploit </b>the <b>natural world</b>. (Q28)","JESS:     Interesting. There’s Gauguin’s picture Vairumati. He did it in Tahiti. It’s a woman with a white bird behind her that is eating a lizard, and what I’m interested in is what idea this bird<b> refers </b>to. Apparently, it’s a<b> reference </b>to the never-ending cycle of existence. (Q29)","TOM:     Wow. I chose a<b> portrait </b>of a little boy, Giovanni de Medici. He’s holding a tiny bird in one fist (Q30). I like the way he’s holding it carefully so he doesn’t hurt it.","JESS:     Ah right.","#4 Stoicism Answers","The Part 4 <b>audio script</b> of Stoicism in <b>Listening Test</b> 1 is as follows:","Ancient<b> philosophy </b>is not just about talking or lecturing, or even reading long, dense books. In fact, it is <b>something people</b> <b>have used</b> throughout history – to solve their problems and to achieve their greatest triumphs.","Specifically, I am<b> referring </b>to Stoicism, which, in my opinion, is the <b>most practical</b> of all<b> philosophies </b>(Q31) and therefore the most appealing.","Stoicism was founded in Ancient Greece by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BC, but was practised by the likes of Epictetus, Cato.","Seneca and <b>Marcus Aurelius</b>. Amazingly, we still <b>have access</b> to these ideas, <b>despite the fact</b> that the <b>most famous</b> Stoics never wrote anything down for publication (Q32). Cato definitely didn’t.","<b>Marcus Aurelius</b> <b>never intended</b> his Meditations to be anything but personal. Seneca’s letters were, well, letters and Epictetus’ thoughts come to us by way of a note-taking student.","<b>Stoic principles</b> were based on the idea that its followers could have an<b> unshakable </b>happiness in this life and the key to achieving this was virtue. The road to virtue, in turn, lay in understanding that destructive emotions, like anger and jealousy, are under our<b> conscious </b>control – they don’t have to control us, because we can <b>learn to control</b> them.","In the words of Epictetus: “external events I cannot control, but the choices I make with regard to them, I do control”. (Q33)","The modern day<b> philosopher </b>and writer Nassim Nicholas Taleb defines a Stoic as <b>someone who has</b> a different<b> perspective </b>on experience which most of us would see as wholly negative (Q34); a Stoic “transforms fear into caution, pain into transformation, mistakes into initiation and desire into undertaking”.","Using this definition as a model, we can see that throughout the centuries <b>Stoicism has</b> been practised in more recent history by kings, presidents, artists, writers and entrepreneurs.","The founding fathers of the <b>United States</b> were inspired by the philosophy. George Washington was introduced to Stoicism by his neighbours at age seventeen, and later, put on a play based on the life of Cato to inspire his men (Q35). Thomas Jefferson kept a copy of Seneca beside his bed.","Writers and artists <b>have also</b> been inspired by the stoics. Eugène Delacroix, the <b>renowned French</b><b> Romantic </b>artist (known best for his painting Liberty Leading the People) was an<b> ardent </b>Stoic,<b> referring </b>to it as his “consoling religion”.","The economist Adam Smith’s theories on<b> capitalism </b>were significantly influenced by the Stoicism (Q36) that he studied as a schoolboy, under a teacher who had translated <b>Marcus Aurelius</b>’ works.","Today’s political leaders are no different, with many finding their<b> inspiration </b>from the ancient texts. Former US president Bill Clinton<b> rereads </b><b>Marcus Aurelius</b> <b>every single</b> year, and <b>many have</b> compared former President Obama’s calm leadership style to that of Cato.","Wen Jiabao, the former prime minister of China, claims that Meditations is one of two books he travels with and that he has read it more than <b>one hundred</b> times over the course of his life.","Stoicism had a profound influence on Albert Ellis, who invented Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (Q37), which is used to help <b>people manage</b> their problems by changing the way that they think and behave.","It’s most commonly <b>used to treat</b> depression. The idea is that we can take control of our lives by challenging the<b> irrational </b>belief that create our faulty thinking,<b> symptoms </b>and behaviours by using logic instead. (Q38)","<b>Stoicism has</b> also become popular in the world of business. <b>Stoic principles</b> can build the<b> resilience </b>and state of mind required to overcome<b> setbacks </b>because Stoics teach turning obstacles into opportunity (Q39). A lesson every business<b> entrepreneur </b>needs to learn.","<b>I </b> would argue that study Stoicism is as<b> relevant </b>today as it was 2,000 <b>years ago</b>, thanks to its brilliant insights into how to lead a good life (Q40). At the very root of the thinking, there is a <b>very simple</b> <b>way of living</b> – control what you can and accept what you can’t.","This is not as easy as it sounds and will require considerable practice – it can take a lifetime to master. The Stoics also believed the <b>most important</b> foundation for a good and happy life is not money, fame, power or pleasure, but having a<b> disciplined </b>and<b> principled </b>character – something which seems to<b> resonate </b>with <b>many <b>people today</b></b>."]},{"name":"GLS/16-2","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Copying photos to digital format Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of <b><b>Copying <b>photos to digital</b></b> format</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 2 is as follows:","EMPLOYEE:     Hello, Picturerep.

I’d <b>like to <b><b>bring you up</b> to date</b></b> with changes in the school that will affect your children.","As you know, the <b>school buildings</b> date from various times: some from the 1970s, some from the last <b>five years</b>, and of course Dartfield House is over a century old. It was<b> commissioned </b>by a businessman. Neville Richards, and intended as his family home, but he died before it was completed.","His heir chose to sell it to the <b>local council</b>, who turned it into offices (Q11). A later plan to convert it into a <b>tourist information</b> centre didn’t come about, through lack of money, and instead it formed the<b> nucleus </b>of this school when it opened 40 <b>years ago</b>.","The <b>school has</b> grown as the <b>local population</b> <b>has increased</b>, and I can now <b>give you some</b> news about the <b>lower school</b> site, which is<b> separated </b>from the <b>main site</b> by a road. Planning permission has been granted for development of both sites.","The <b>lower school</b> will move to <b><b>new building</b>s</b> that will be constructed on the <b>main site</b>. Developers will construct houses on the existing <b>lower school</b> site (Q12). Work on the new <b>school buildings</b> should start within the next <b>few months</b>.","<b>A </b> more<b> imminent </b>change concerns the catering<b> facilities </b>and the canteen. The<b> canteen </b>is <b>always very</b> busy throughout the lunch period – in fact it’s often full to capacity, <b>because a lot</b> of our pupils like the food that’s on offer there.","But there’s <b>only one</b> <b>serving point</b>, so most pupils <b>have to wait</b> a considerable time to be served (Q13). This is obviously unsatisfactory, as they may have <b>hardly finished</b> their lunch before afternoon lessons start.","So we’ve had a <b>new <b>Food Hall</b></b> built, and this will come into use <b>next week</b>. It’ll <b>have several</b> serving areas, and I’ll give you more details about those in a minute, but <b>one thing</b> we ask you to do, to help in the smooth running of the <b>Food Hall</b>, is to discuss with your children <b>each morning</b> which type of food they want to eat that day (Q14), so they can <b>go straight</b> to the<b> relevant </b><b>serving point</b>.","There won’t be any junk food – everything on offer will be healthy – and there’s no change to the current system of paying for lunches by topping up your child’s<b> electronic </b>payment card online.","You may be wondering what will happen to the old canteen. We’ll <b>still have</b> <b>tables and chairs</b> in there, and pupils can <b>eat food</b> from the <b>Food Hall</b> or lunch they’ve brought from home (Q15). Eventually we may use part of the<b> canteen </b>for storage, but first we’ll <b>see how many</b> pupils go in there at lunchtime.","————————-","OK, back to the <b>serving point</b>s in the <b>Food Hall</b>, which will <b>all have</b> side dishes, desserts and drinks on sale, as well as main courses.","One <b>serving point</b> we call World Adventures (Q16). This will serve a different country’s<b> cuisine </b><b>each day</b>, maybe Chinese <b>one day</b> and Lebanese the next. The menus will be planned for a week at a time, so pupils will know what’s going to be available the whole of the week.","Street Life is also international, with food from three particular cultures. We’ll ask pupils to <b>make suggestions</b> (Q17), so perhaps sometimes there’ll be food from Thailand, Ethiopia and Mexico, and then one of them will be replaced by Jamaican food for a <b>week or two</b>.","The Speedy Italian <b>serving point</b> will cater particularly for the <b>many pupils</b> who don’t <b>eat meat</b> or fish (Q18): they can be sure that <b>all the food</b> served there is suitable for them. There’ll be plenty of variety, so they shouldn’t <b>get bored</b> with the food.","OK, that’s all on the <b>new <b>Food Hall</b></b>. Now after-school lessons. There are <b>very popular</b> with pupils, particularly swimming – in fact there’s a <b>waiting list</b> for lessons. Cycling is another favourite, and I’m delighted that dozens of pupils <b>make use</b> of the chance to learn to ride in off-road conditions.","It means that more and more cycle to and from school <b>every day</b>. As you know, we have a well-equipped performance centre, and we’re <b>going to start</b> drama classes (Q19/Q20) in there, too. <b>Pupils will be able</b> to join in just for fun or <b>work up</b> to <b>taking part</b> in a play – we hope to put on at <b>least one</b> a year. We already teach a number of pupils to use the sound and lighting systems in the centre.","And a former pupil <b>has given</b> a magnificent grand piano to the school, so a few <b>pupils will be able</b> to learn at the school <b>instead of going</b> to the local college, as many of them do at the moment.","#3 <b><b>Assignment on sleep</b> and dreams</b> Transcript","The Part 3 <b>audio script</b> of <b><b>Assignment on sleep</b> and dreams</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 2 is as follows:","SUSIE:     So Luke, for our next<b> psychology </b>assignment we have to <b><b>do some</b>thing</b> on <b>sleep and dreams</b>.","LUKE:      Right. I’ve just <b>read an article</b> suggesting why we tend to forget most of our dreams soon after we <b>wake up</b>. I mean, most of my dreams aren’t that interesting anyway, but what it said was that if we remembered everything, we might get mixed up about what actually happened and what we dreamed (Q21). So it’s a sort of protection. I hadn’t heard that idea before. I’d always assumed that it was just that we didn’t have room in our memories for all that stuff.","SUSIE:     <b>Me too</b>. What <b>do you think</b> about the idea that our dreams may <b>predict the future</b>?","LUKE:      It’s a belief that you get <b>all over the world</b>.","SUSIE:     Yeah, <b>lots of people</b> have a story of it happening to them, but the explanation I’ve read is that for each dream that comes true, we have thousands that don’t (Q22), but we don’t notice those, we don’t even remember them. We just remember the ones where something in the real world, like a view or an action, happens to trigger a dream memory.","LUKE:      Right. So it’s just a<b> coincidence </b>really. Something else I read about is what they call<b> segmented </b>sleeping. That’s a theory that <b>hundreds of years</b> ago, <b><b>people use</b>d</b> to <b>get up</b> in the middle of the night and have a chat or something to eat, then <b>go back</b> to bed. So I tried it myself.","SUSIE:     Why?","LUKE:      Well it’s meant to make you more creative. I don’t know why. But I gave it up after a week. It just didn’t fit in with my lifestyle.","SUSIE:     But most pre-school <b>children have</b> a short sleep in the day don’t they? There was an experiment <b>some students</b> did here last term to see at what age kids should stop having naps. But they didn’t really find an answer (Q23). They spent a lot of <b>time working</b> out the <b>most appropriate</b> methodology, but the results didn’t <b><b>seem to show</b> any</b> obvious patterns.","LUKE:      Right. Anyway, let’s think about our assignment. <b>Last time</b> I <b>had problems</b> with the <b>final stage</b>, where we had to describe and justify how successful we thought we’d been (Q24). I struggled a bit with the <b>action plan</b> too.","SUSIE:     I was OK with the planning, but I got <b>marked down</b> for the self-assessment as well. And I had big problems with the<b> statistical </b>stuff, that’s where I really lost marks.","LUKE:      Right.","————————–","SUSIE:     So shall we plan what we <b>have to do</b> for this assignment?","LUKE:      OK.","SUSIE:     First, we <b>have to decide</b> on our research question. So how about ‘Is there a relationship between hours of sleep and <b>number of dreams</b>?’","LUKE:      OK. Then we <b>need to think</b> about who we’ll do they study on. About 12 people?","SUSIE:     Right. And shall we <b>use other</b><b> psychology </b>students?","LUKE:      Let’s use people from a different department. What about history? (Q25)","SUSIE:     Yes, they might have interesting dreams! Or literature students?","LUKE:      I don’t <b>really know</b> any.","SUSIE:     OK, forget that idea. Then we have to think about our methodology. So we could use observation, but that doesn’t seem appropriate.","LUKE:      No. it needs to be self-reporting I think. And we could ask them to <b>answer questions</b> online.","SUSIE:     But in this case, paper might be better (Q26) as they’ll be doing it<b> straight </b>after they <b>wake up</b> … in fact while they’re still half-asleep.","LUKE:      Right. And we’ll have to check the<b> ethical </b>guidelines (Q27) for this sort of research.","SUSIE:     Mm, because our experiment involves humans, so there are special regulations.","LUKE:      Yes, I <b>had a look</b> at those for another assignment I did. There’s a whole section on <b>risk assessment</b>, and another section on <b>making sure</b> they aren’t put under any unnecessary stress. (Q28)","SUSIE:     Let’s hope they don’t <b>have any</b> bad dreams!","LUKE:      Yeah.","SUSIE:     Then when we’ve collected all our data we <b>have to analyse</b> it and calculate the correlation between our two variables, that’s time sleeping and <b>number of dreams</b> and then present our results visually in a graph. (Q29)","LUKE:      Right. And the <b>final thing</b> is to think about our research and evaluate it (Q30). So that seems <b>quite straightforward</b>.","SUSIE:     Yeah. So <b>now let</b>’s …","#4 <b>Health <b>benefits of dance</b></b> Transcript","The Part 4 <b>audio script</b> of <b>Health <b>benefits of dance</b></b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 2 is as follows:","Dancing is something that humans do when they <b><b>want to have</b> a good</b> time. It’s a universal response to music, found in all cultures. But what’s only been discovered recently is that dancing not only <b><b>makes us feel</b> good</b>, it’s also extremely good for our health.","Dancing, like <b>other forms</b> of exercise, releases hormones, such as dopamine, which <b>make us feel</b> relaxed and happy. And it <b>also reduces</b> feelings of stress or anxiety.","Dancing is also a<b> sociable </b>activity, which is <b>another reason</b> it <b><b>makes us feel</b> good</b>.","<b>One study</b> compared people’s enjoyment of dancing at home in front of a video with <b>dancing in a group</b> in a studio.","The people <b>dancing in a group</b> reported feeling happier, whereas those dancing alone did not.","In another experiment, university researchers at York and Sheffield took a group of students and sent each of them into a lab where music was played for <b>five minutes</b>. <b>Each had</b> to choose from three options: to sit and listen quietly to the music, to cycle on an exercise bike while they listened, or to <b>get up</b> and dance.","All were given <b>cognitive tasks</b> to perform before and after. The result showed that those who chose to dance showed much more creativity (Q31) when doing problem-solving tasks.","Doctor Lovatt at the University of Hertfordshire believes dance could be a very <b>useful way</b> to <b>help people</b> suffering from mental <b>health problems</b>. He thinks dance should be<b> prescribed </b>ad therapy (Q32) to <b>help people</b> overcome <b>issues such</b> as depression.","————————","It’s <b>well established</b> that dance is a <b>good way</b> of encouraging adolescent girls to take exercise but what about <b>older people</b>? <b><b>Studies have</b> shown</b> that there are enormous benefits for people in their sixties and beyond.","<b><b>One of the great</b> things</b> about dance is that there are no barriers to participation. Anyone can <b>have a go</b>, even those whose standard of fitness is quite low. (Q33)","Dance can be especially beneficial for older adults who can’t run or do more intense workouts, or for those who don’t want to. One 2015 study <b>found that even</b> a gently dance workout helps to promote a healthy heart.","And there’s <b>plenty of evidence</b> which suggests that dancing lowers the risk of falls, which could result in a broken hip, for example, by helping <b>people to improve</b> their balance. (Q34)","T<b>here are some</b> <b>less obvious</b> <b>benefits of dance</b> for <b>older people</b> too. <b>One thing</b> I hadn’t realised before researching this topic was that dance isn’t just a <b>physical challenge</b>.","It also requires a lot of<b> concentration </b>because you need to remember <b>different steps</b> and routines. For <b>older people</b>, this kind of activity is especially <b>important because</b> it forces their brain to process things more quickly (Q35) and to retain more information.","Current <b><b>research also</b> shows</b> that dance promotes a general sense of well-being in older participants, which can last up to a week after a class. Participants report feeling less tired and having greater motivation to be more active (Q36) and do daily <b>activities such</b> as gardening or walking to the shops or a park.","Ballroom or country dancing, both popular with <b>older people</b>. They require collaboration and <b>often involve</b> touching a dance partner, all of which encourages interaction on the dance floor.","This helps to <b>develop new</b> relationships and can reduce <b>older people</b>’s sense of isolation (Q37), which is a <b>huge problem</b> in <b>many countries</b>.","<b>I </b> also looked at the benefits of Zumba. Fifteen <b>million people</b> in 180 countries now regularly take a Zumba class, an aerobic workout based on <b>Latin American</b> dance moves.","John Porcari, a professor of exercise and sport science at the University of Wisconsin, analysed a group of women who were Zumba regulars and found that a class lasting 40 minutes burns about 370 calories. This is similar to moderately intense exercises (Q38) like step aerobics or kickboxing.","<b>A </b> study in the American Journal of Health Behavior showed that when women with<b> obesity </b>(Q39) did Zumba three <b>times a week</b> for 16 weeks, they lost an average of 1.2<b> kilos </b>and lowered their percentage of body fat by 1%. More importantly, the women enjoyed the class so much that they made it a habit (Q40) and continued to <b>attend classes</b> at least <b>once a week</b> – very<b> unusual </b>for an <b>aerobic exercise</b> programme.","Dance is <b>never going</b> to compete with high-intensity workouts when it comes to <b>physical fitness</b> gains, but its<b> popularity </b>is likely to keep on rising because it’s such a fun <b>way to keep</b> fit."]},{"name":"GLS/16-3","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Junior cycle camp Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of <b><b>Junior cycle</b> camp</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 3 is as follows:","JAKE:            Hello, <b><b>Junior Cycle</b> camp</b>, Jake speaking.","WOMAN:     Hi.

Well, it’s held every weekday morning over the summer<b> vacation </b>and we focus on basic <b>cycling skills</b> and safety. We have eight levels for <b>children from three</b> years upwards. How old’s your son?","WOMAN:     Charlie? He’s seven. He can ride a bike, but he needs a little more training before he’s safe to go on the road.","JAKE:            He’d probably be best in Level 5. They start off practising on the site here, and we <b>aim to get</b> them riding on the road, but first they’re taken to ride in the park (Q1), away from the traffic.","WOMAN:     Right. And can you <b>tell <b>me a bit</b></b> about the instructors?","JAKE:            Well, all our staff wear <b>different coloured</b> shirts. So, we <b>have three</b> supervisors, and they have red shirts. They support the instructors, and they also stand in for me if I’m not around. Then the instructors themselves are in blue shirts (Q2), and one of these is<b> responsible </b>for each class.","WOMAN:     OK.","JAKE:            In order to be accepted, all our instructors have to submit a<b> reference </b>(Q3) from someone who’s seen them work with children – like if they’ve worked as a babysitter, for example. Then they have to complete our <b>training course</b>, including how to do lesson plans, and generally care for the well-being of the kids in their class.

And a snack (Q6) for break time.","WOMAN:     How about a drink?","JAKE:            No, we’ll provide that. And <b>make <b>sure he has</b></b> shoes, not sandals.","WOMAN:     Sure.

The classes normally start at 9.30 every morning, but on Day 1 you should <b>aim to get</b> Charlie here by 9.20. The finishing time will be 12.30 as usual. We need the additional <b>time because</b> there are a few extra <b>things to do</b>. The <b>most important</b> is that we have a <b>very careful</b> check to <b>make sure</b> that every child’s helmet fits properly (Q8). If it doesn’t fit, we’ll try to adjust it, or we’ll find him <b>an<b>other one</b></b> – but he must wear it <b>all the time</b> he’s on the bike.","WOMAN:     Of course.","JAKE:            Then after that, all the instructors will be waiting to meet their classes, and they’ll meet up in the tent (Q9) – you can’t miss it.

It took me ages to decide exactly how I’d organise it, especially how I could <b>make sure</b> that people didn’t know which drink I was giving them (Q21/Q22). It was hard to <b>keep track</b> of it all, especially as I had so <b>many people</b> doing it (Q21/Q22) – I <b>had to make</b> sure I kept a proper record of what <b>each person</b> <b>had had</b>.","ROSIE:      So could <b>most people</b> <b>tell the difference</b>?","ADAM:     Yeah – I hadn’t thought they would be able to, but <b>most people</b> could.","ROSIE:      Then there’s that <b>experiment I did</b> measuring the <b>fat content</b> of nuts, to see if the<b> nutritional </b>information given on the packet was accurate.","ADAM:     The one where you <b>ground <b>up the nuts</b></b> and mixed them with a chemical to absorb the fat?","ROSIE:      Yes. My results were a bit<b> problematic </b>– the <b>fat content</b> for that type of nut seemed much lower than it said on the package. But I reckon the package information was right. I think I should <b>probably have</b> <b>ground <b>up the nuts</b></b> more than I did. It’s possible that the scales for weighing the fat weren’t accurate enough (Q23/Q24), too. I’d <b>really like</b> to try the experiment again <b>some time</b>.","———————-","ADAM:     So what can we say about <b>helping people</b> to <b>lose weight</b>? There’s a lot we could say about what restaurants could do to reduce obesity. I read that the items at the start of a menu and the items at the end of a menu. They are much more likely to be chosen than the items in the middle. So, if you put the low-calorie items at the <b>beginning and end</b> of the menu, people will probably go for the food with fewer calories (Q25), without even realising what they’re doing.","ROSIE:      I think <b>food manufacturers</b> could do more to <b><b>encourage healthy</b> eating</b>.","ADAM:     How?","ROSIE:      Well, when manufacturers put calorie counts of a food on the label, they’re sometimes really confusing and I<b> suspect </b>they do it on purpose (Q26). Because food that’s <b>high in calories</b> tastes better, and so they’ll sell more.","ADAM:     Yeah, so if you look at the amount of calories in a pizza, they’ll give you the calories per <b>quarter pizza</b> and you think, oh that’s not <b>too bad</b>. But who’s going to eat a <b>quarter pizza</b>?","ROSIE:      Exactly.","ADAM:     I suppose another approach to this problem is to <b>get people</b> to exercise more.","ROSIE:      Right. In England, the current guidelines are for at least 30 minutes of<b> brisk </b>walking, five <b>days a week</b>. Now when you ask them, about 40% of men and 30% of women say they do this, but when you objectively measure the amount of walking they do with motion sensors, you find that only 6% of men and 4% of women do the recommended amount of exercise. (Q27)","ADAM:     Mm, so you can see why<b> obesity </b>is growing.","ROSIE:      So how can people encourage to take more exercise?","ADAM:     Well, for example, think of the location of stairs station. if people reach the stairs before they reach the escalator when they’re leaving the station, they’re more likely to take the stairs. And if you increase the width of the stairs, you’ll <b>get more people</b> using them at the <b>same time</b> (Q28). It’s an<b> unconscious </b>process and influenced by minor modifications in their environment.","ROSIE:      Right. And it might not be a big change, but if it happens <b>every day</b>, it all adds up.","ADAM:     Yes. But actually, I’m not sure if we should be talking about exercise in our presentation. (Q29)","ROSIE:      Well, we’ve done <b>quite a bit</b> of reading about it.","ADAM:     I know, but it’s going to mean we <b>have a very</b> wide focus, and our tutor did say that we <b>need to focus</b> on causes and solutions in terms of nutrition.","ROSIE:      I suppose so. And we’ve got <b>plenty of information</b> about that. OK, well that will be simpler.","ADAM:     So what shall we <b>do now</b>?

So today we’re <b>going to <b>look at an important</b></b> creative activity and that’s <b>hand knitting</b>. Ancient <b>knitted garments</b> <b>have been found</b> in many <b>different countries</b>. Showing that<b> knitting </b>is a global activity with a long history.","When someone says the word ‘knitting’ we might well picture an elderly person – a grandmother perhaps – sitting by the fire<b> knitting </b>(Q31) garments for themselves or other <b>members of the family</b>. It’s a homely image, but one that may lead you to feel that<b> knitting </b>is an activity of the past – and, indeed, during the previous decade, it was one of the skills that was predicted to<b> vanish </b>(Q32) from <b>everyday life</b>.","For although <b>humans have</b><b> sewn </b>and<b> knitted </b>their own clothing for a very <b>long time</b>, many of these craft-based skills went into decline when<b> industrial </b>machines took over – mainly because they were <b>no longer</b> <b>passed down</b> from <b>one generation</b> to another.","However, that’s all changing and interest in<b> knitting </b>classes in <b>many countries</b> is actually rising, as more and more people are seeking formal instruction in the skill. With that trend, we’re <b>also see</b>ing an increase in the <b>sales figures</b> for<b> knitting </b>equipment. (Q34)","So why <b>do <b>people want</b></b> to be taught to knit at a time when a machine can readily <b>do the job</b> for them? The answer is that knitting, as a handicraft, <b>has numerous</b> benefits for those doing it. Let’s consider what some of these might be.","While <b>many people</b> <b>knitted garments</b> in the <b>past because</b> they couldn’t <b>afford to buy</b> clothes, it’s still true today that<b> knitting </b>can be helpful if you’re experiencing economic hardship (Q34). If you <b>have several</b> children who all need <b>warm winter</b> clothes,<b> knitting </b>may save you a <b>lot of money</b>.","And the results of<b> knitting </b>your own clothes can be very rewarding, <b>even though</b> the skills you <b><b>need to get</b> going</b> are really quite basic (Q35) and the financial<b> outlay </b>is minimal.","But the more significant benefits in today’s world are to do with well-being. In a world where it’s<b> estimated </b>that we sp<b>end up</b> to nine hours a day online, <b><b>doing some</b>thing</b> with our hands that is craft-based <b><b>makes us feel</b> good</b>. It releases us from the stress of a technological, fast-paced life.","———————","Now, let’s <b>look back</b> a bit <b>too early</b><b> knitting </b>activities. In fact, <b>no <b>one <b><b>really know</b>s</b></b></b> when<b> knitting </b>first began. But archaeological remains have<b> disclosed </b><b>plenty of information</b> for us to think about.","One of the interesting things about<b> knitting </b>is that the earliest pieces of <b>clothing that have</b> been found <b>suggest that most</b> of the items produced were round (Q36) rather than flat. Discoveries from the 3rd and 4th centuries in Egypt show that <b>things like</b> socks and gloves, that were <b>needed to keep</b> hands and feet warm, were<b> knitted </b>in one piece using <b>four or five</b> needles.","That’s very <b>different from most</b><b> knitting </b>patterns today, which only require two. What’s more, the very <b>first need</b>les <b><b>people use</b>d</b> were hand carved out of wood and other natural materials, like bone (Q37), whereas today’s needles are largely made of<b> steel </b>or plastic and make that characteristic clicking sound when someone’s using them. <b>Ancient people</b><b> knitted </b>using yarns made from linen, hemp, <b>cotton and wool</b>, and these were often very rough on the skin (Q38).","The<b> spinning </b>wheel, which <b>allowed people</b> to make finer yarns and produce <b>much greater</b> quantities of them, led to the<b> dominance </b>of<b> wool </b>in the<b> knitting </b>industry – often favoured for its warmth.","Another interesting fact about<b> knitting </b>is that because it was practised in so <b>many <b>parts of the world</b></b> for so many purposes, regional differences in style developed (Q39). This visual identity has <b>allowed researchers</b> to match bits of<b> knitted </b><b>clothing that have</b> been<b> unearthed </b>over time to the region from which the wearer came or the job that he or she did.","As I’ve mentioned,<b> knitting </b>offered people from poor communities a <b>way of making</b> extra money while doing other tasks. For <b>many centuries</b>, it seems, men, women and children took every opportunity to knit, for example, while watching over sheep (Q40), walking to market or riding in boats. So, let’s move on to take a …"]},{"name":"GLS/16-4","paragraph":["<h2>#1 Holiday rental Transcript</h2>","The Part 1 <b>audio script</b> of <b>Holiday rental</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 4 is as follows:","SHIRLEY:     Hello?","TOM:           <b>Oh hello</b>.

It’s free the <b>week beginning</b> the 28th (Q1), though, for seven nights. In fact, that’s the only time you could have it in May.","TOM:           Oh. Well, we could manage that, I think. We’d just <b>need to change</b> a couple of things. How much would it cost?","SHIRLEY:     That’s the beginning of high season, so it’d be £550 for the week. (Q2)","TOM:           Ah. That’s a bit more than we wanted to pay, I’m afraid. We’ve budgeted up to £500 for accommodation.","SHIRLEY:     Well, we’ve <b>just finished</b> converting another building into a cottage, which we’re calling Chervil Cottage.

It sometimes gets quite cool at that <b>time of year</b>.","SHIRLEY:     There’s central heating, and if you want to light a fire, there’s a stove. We can provide all the wood you need for it (Q7).

Well, we <b>now have</b> the results of the survey carried out last month about traffic and <b>road transport</b> in the town. <b>People were generally</b> satisfied with the state of the roads. There were <b>one or two</b> complaints about<b> potholes </b>which will be addressed, but a <b>significant number</b> of people complained about the <b>increasing number</b> of heavy<b> vehicles </b>(Q11) using our local roads to avoid traffic elsewhere.","We’d expected more complaints by<b> commuters </b>about the<b> reduction </b>in the train service, but it doesn’t seem to <b>have affected</b> <b>people too</b> much. The <b>cycle path</b> that runs <b>alongside the river</b> is <b><b>very well</b> used</b> by both cyclists and<b> pedestrians </b>since the surface was improved <b>last year</b>, but<b> overtaking </b>can be a problem so we’re going to <b>add a bit</b> on the side to make it wider (Q12). At some stage, we’d like to extend the path so that it goes <b>all the way</b> through the town, but that won’t be happening in the immediate future.","The plans to <b>have a <b>pedestrian crossing</b></b> next to the <b>Post Office</b> have unfortunately had to be put on hold for the time being. We’d budgeted for this to be done this financial year, but then there were<b> rumours </b>that the <b>Post Office</b> was going to move, which would <b>have meant</b> there wasn’t really a need for a crossing. Now they’ve confirmed that they’re staying where they are, but the Highways Department have told us that it would be dangerous to <b>have a <b>pedestrian crossing</b></b> where we’d originally planned it as there’s a bend in the road there (Q13). So that’ll <b>need some</b> more thought.","On Station Road near the station and level crossing, drivers can face <b>quite long</b> waits if the level crossing’s closed, and we’ve <b>now got</b> signs up requesting them not to leave their engines running at that time (Q14). This means<b> pedestrians </b>waiting on the<b> pavement </b>to cross the <b>railway line</b> don’t have to breathe in car fumes. We’ve had <b>some problems</b> with cyclists leaving their bikes chained to the<b> railings </b>outside the ticket office, but the station has agreed to provide bike racks there.","———————","CHAIRPERSON:","So <b>next on the agenda</b> is ‘Proposals for improvements to the<b> recreation </b>ground’. <b>Councillor Thornton</b> again.","<b>COUNCILLOR THORNTON</b>:","Well, since we managed to extend the<b> recreation </b>ground, we’ve spent <b>some time</b> talking to <b>local people</b> about how it could be made a more attractive and useful space. If you have a <b>look at the map</b> up on the screen, you can see the river up in the north, and the <b>Community Hall</b> near the <b>entrance from the road</b>.","At present, cars can park between the <b>Community Hall</b> and that <b>line of trees</b> to the east, but this is quite dangerous for<b> pedestrians </b>so we’re suggesting a new <b>car park</b> on the <b>opposite side</b> of the <b>Community Hall</b>, <b>right next</b> to it (Q15). We <b>also have</b> a <b>new location</b> for the<b> cricket </b>pitch.","As we’ve now purchased additional space to the east of the<b> recreation </b>ground, beyond the trees (Q16), we <b>plan to move</b> it away from its current location, which is rather near the road, into this <b>new area</b> beyond the <b>line of trees</b>. This means there’s less danger of<b> stray </b>balls hitting cars or pedestrians.","We’ve got plans for a children’s playground which will be accessible by a footpath from the <b>Community Hall</b> and will be <b>alongside the river</b> (Q17). We’d originally thought of having it close to the road, but we think this will be a more attractive location.","The <b>skateboard ramp</b> is <b>very popular</b> with both younger and <b>older children</b> – we had considered moving this up towards the river, but in the <b>end we decided</b> to have it in the southeast corner near the road (Q18). The<b> pavilion </b>is <b><b>very well</b> used</b> at present by both football players and cricketers. It will stay where it is now – to the left of the <b>line of trees</b> and near to the river (Q19) – handy for both the football and<b> cricket </b>pitches. And finally, we’ll be getting a new notice board for local information, and that will be directly on people’s right as they go from the road into the<b> recreation </b>ground. (Q20)","#3 Part 3 Transcript","The Part 3 <b>audio <b>transcript in Cambridge</b></b> 16 <b>Listening Test</b> 4 is as follows:","JAKE:     Now that we’ve done all the research into bike-sharing schemes in cities a<b>round the world</b>, we <b>need to think</b> about how we’re going to organise our report.","AMY:     Right. I think we should start by talking about the benefits. I mean it’s great that so many cities <b>have introduced</b> these schemes where anyone can <b>pick up</b> a bike from dozens of <b>different locations</b> and hire it for a <b>few hours</b>. It makes riding a bike very convenient for people.","JAKE:     Yes, but the costs can add up and that puts people on low incomes off in <b>some places</b>.","AMY:     I suppose so, but if it means more people in general are <b>cycling rather</b> than driving, then because they’re increasing the amount of <b>physical activity</b> they do, it’s good for their health","JAKE:     OK. But isn’t that of less importance? I mean, doesn’t the impact of reduced<b> emissions </b>on <b>air pollution</b> have a more <b>significant effect</b> on people’s health? (Q21/Q22)","AMY:     Certainly, in some cities bike-sharing <b>had made</b> a big contribution to that. And <b>also help</b>ed to cut the number of <b>cars on the road</b> significantly. (Q21/Q22)","JAKE:     Which is the <b>main point</b>.","AMY:     Exactly. But I’d say it’s had less of an impact on noise <b>pollution because</b> there are still loads of buses and<b> lorries </b>around.","JAKE:     Right.","AMY:     Shall we quickly discuss the recommendations we’re going to make?","JAKE:     In order to ensure bike-sharing schemes are successful?","AMY:     Yes.","JAKE:     OK. Well, while I think it’s nice to <b>have really</b> state-of-the art bikes with <b>things like</b> GPS, I wouldn’t say they’re absolutely necessary.","AMY:     But some technical things are <b>really important</b> – like a <b>fully functional</b> app – so people can make payments and book bikes easily (Q23/Q24). Places which haven’t invested in that <b>have really</b> struggled.","JAKE:     <b>Good point</b> … <b>Some people</b> say there shouldn’t be competing companies offering separate bike-sharing schemes, but in <b>some really</b> big cities, competition’s beneficial and anyway one company might not be <b>able to manage</b> the <b>whole thing</b>.","AMY:     Right. Deciding how much to invest is a big question. Cities which have opened loads of new bike<b> lanes </b>at the <b>same time</b> as introducing bike-sharing schemes <b>have generally</b> been more successful – but there are examples of successful schemes where this hasn’t happened … What <b>does matter</b> though – is <b>having a big</b> publicity campaign. (Q23/Q24)","JAKE:     Definitely. If <b>people do</b>n’t know how to use the scheme or don’t understand its benefits, they won’t use it. People <b>need a lot</b> of<b> persuasion </b>to stop using their cars.","—————————-","AMY:     Shall we <b>look at <b>some examples</b></b> now? And say what we think is good or bad about them.","JAKE:     I suppose we should start with Amsterdam as this was <b>one of the first</b> cities to have a bike-sharing scheme.","AMY:     Yes. There was already a strong culture of cycling here. In a way it’s strange that there was such a demand for bike-sharing because you’d <b>have thought</b> most <b>people would have</b> used their own bikes. (Q25)","JAKE:     And yet it’s <b>one of the best</b>-used schemes … Dublin’s an interesting example of a success story.","AMY:     It must be because the <b>public transport</b> system’s quite limited. (Q26)","JAKE:     Not really – there’s no underground, but there are<b> trams </b>and a good bus network. I’d say price <b>has a lot</b> to do with it. It’s one of the cheapest schemes in Europe to join.","AMY:     But the buses are <b>really slow</b> – anyway the weather certainly can’t be a factor!","JAKE:     No – definitely not. The London scheme’s been quite successful","AMY:     Yes – it’s been a <b>really good</b> thing for the city. The bikes are popular and the whole system is well maintained but it isn’t expanding quickly enough.","JAKE:     Basically, not enough’s been spent on increasing the number of <b>cycle lanes</b> (Q27). Hopefully that’ll change.","AMY:     Yes. Now what about outside Europe?","JAKE:     Well bike-sharing <b>schemes have</b> taken off in places like Buenos Aires.","AMY:     Mmm. They built a huge network of <b>cycle lanes</b> to support the introduction of the scheme there, didn’t they? It attracted <b><b>huge number</b>s</b> of cyclists where previously there were <b>hardly any</b>.","JAKE:     An example of good planning. (Q28)","AMY:     Absolutely. <b>New York</b> is a <b>good example</b> of how not to introduce a scheme. When they launched it, it was more than <b>ten times</b> the price of <b>most other</b> schemes.","JAKE:     More than it costs to take a taxi, Crazy (Q29). I think the organisers lacked vision and ambition there.","AMY:     I think so too. Sydney would be a <b>good example</b> to use. I would <b>have expected</b> it to <b>have grown</b> pretty quickly here. (Q30)","JAKE:     Yes. I can’t quite work out why it hasn’t been an instant success like <b>some of the other</b>s. It’s a shame really.","AMY:     I know. OK so now we’ve thought about …","#4 The <b><b>extinction of Dodo</b> bird</b> Transcript","The Part 4 <b>audio script</b> of The <b><b>extinction of Dodo</b> bird</b> in <b>Listening Test</b> 4 is as follows:","<b><b>One of the most</b> famous</b> cases of extinction is that of a bird known as the dodo. In fact there’s even a saying in English, ‘as dead as the dodo’, used to refer to something which <b>no longer</b> exists. But for <b>many centuries</b> the<b> dodo </b>was alive and well, although it could only be found in one place, the island of Mauritius in the <b>Indian Ocean</b>.","It was a <b>very large</b> bird, about one metre tall, and over the centuries it <b>had <b>lost the ability</b></b> to fly, but it survived happily under the trees that covered the island.","Then in the year 1507 the first Portuguese ships stopped at the island. The sailors were carrying<b> spices </b>(Q31) back to Europe, and found the island a convenient stopping place where they could stock up with <b>food and water</b> for the rest of the voyage, but they didn’t settle on Mauritius.","However, in 1683 the <b>Dutch arrived</b> and <b>set up</b> a colony (Q32) there. These first human<b> inhabitants </b>of the island found the <b>dodo bird</b>s a convenient source of meat, although not everyone liked the taste.","It’s hard to get an accurate description of what the<b> dodo </b>actually <b>looked like</b>. We do <b>have some</b> written records from sailors, and a few pictures, but we don’t know how reliable these are. The best-known picture is a Dutch painting in which the bird appears to be extremely fat (Q33), but this may not be accurate – an Indian painting done at the <b>same time</b> shows a much thinner bird.","Although <b>attempts were made</b> to<b> preserve </b>the bodies of some of the birds, no complete<b> specimen </b>survives. In the early 17th century four<b> dried </b>parts of a bird were known to exist – of these, three have disappeared, so only <b>one example</b> of soft tissue from the<b> dodo </b>survives, a<b> dodo </b>head (Q34). Bones have <b>also found</b>, but there’s <b>only one</b> complete skeleton in existence.","This single<b> dodo </b>skeleton <b>has recently</b> been the subject of scientific research which suggests that many of the earlier beliefs about<b> dodos </b>may have been incorrect. For example, early accounts of the birds mention how slow and clumsy it was, but <b><b>scientists now</b> believe</b> the bird’s strong knee joints would <b>have made</b> it capable of movement (Q35) which was not slow, but <b>actually quite</b> fast.","In fact, one 17th century sailor wrote that he found the birds hard to catch. It’s true that the dodo’s small wings wouldn’t <b><b>have all</b>owed</b> it to leave the ground, but the scientists suggest that these were probably employed for balance (Q36) while going over uneven ground.","<b>Another group</b> of scientists carried out analysis of the dodo’s skull. They found that the reports of the lack of intelligence of the<b> dodo </b>were not borne out by their research, which suggested the bird’s brain (Q37) was not small, but average in size. In fact, in relation to its body size, it was similar to that of the pigeon, which is known to be a highly intelligent bird.","The researchers <b>also found</b> that the structure of the bird’s skull <b>suggested that one</b> sense which was particularly well-developed was that of smell (Q38). So the<b> dodo </b>may also <b>have been particularly</b> good at locating ripe fruit and <b>other food</b> in the island’s <b>thick vegetation</b>.","————————————–","So it looks as if the<b> dodo </b>was <b>better able</b> to survive and defend itself than was originally believed. Yet less than 200 years after Europeans first arrived on the island, they had <b>become extinct</b>. So what was the reason for this? For a <b>long time</b>, it was believed that the<b> dodos </b>were hunted to extinction, but <b><b>scientists now</b> believe</b> the situation was more complicated than this.","Another factor may have been the <b>new species</b> <b>brought to the island</b> by the sailors. These included dogs, which would have been a threat to the dodos, and also monkeys, which ate the fruit that was the <b>main part</b> of the dodos’ diet. These were <b>brought to the island</b> deliberately, but the ships also brought <b>another type</b> of creature – rats (Q39), which came to land from the ships and rapidly<b> overran </b>the island.","These upset the<b> ecology </b>of the island, not just the<b> dodos </b>but <b>other species</b> too. However, they were a particular danger to the<b> dodos </b>because they consumed their eggs, and since each<b> dodo </b>only<b> laid </b>one at a time, this <b>probably had</b> a<b> devastating </b>effect on populations.","However, we <b>now think</b> that probably the <b>main cause</b> of the birds’ extinction was not the introduction of non-native species, but the introduction of agriculture.","This meant that the forest (Q40) that has once covered all the island, and that had provided a perfect home for the dodo, was cut down so that <b>crops such</b> as sugar could be grown. So although the<b> dodo </b>had survived for <b>thousands of years</b>, suddenly it was gone.","———————"]},{"name":"GRE/10-1","paragraph":["<b>Smoke alarms</b> are now a standard feature in Australian homes and are required by the National Building Code in any <b>recently built</b> properties.

If you are contacting a business, it is important to address the letter to the decision maker, ideally by name or at least by job title.","While the desirability and price of the product on offer will obviously influence sales, you <b>also need</b> to gain the maximum impact from your <b>sales letter</b>. To achieve that, bear the following points in mind:","•   You <b>have no</b> more than two seconds from when the reader starts the letter to convince them to continue. If you fail, they will throw it away. The opening is crucial to attract their attention. And so that they don’t lose interest, <b>avoid having</b> <b>too much</b> text.","•   Try to send each mailing in a white envelope. It might be cheaper to use a brown envelope but it doesn’t make for such good presentation.","•   Include a brochure. Depending on the volume and on whether you can afford the cost, try to use at least two-colour printing for this. If practicable, it may be worth enclosing a free sample – this is a <b>much greater</b> incentive than photographs.","•   However interested your potential clients are in buying, they will only do so if it can be done easily. So, include an order form (and of course details of how to return it) with your letter.","•   When you receive your replies, assess your response rate and monitor the sales. If necessary, the <b>sales letter</b> can then be amended to attract other clients on subsequent mail shots; <b>make sure</b> each different letter is coded so that monitoring is easy and effective.","•   Ensure that each reply is dealt with quickly and professionally. If further details are requested, these must be sent out promptly. There is no point in encouraging <b>potential customers</b> to contact you if your service is slow or non-existent.","<b>A</b>","The<b> kauri </b>tree is a massive forest tree native to <b>New Zealand</b>.<b> Kauri </b>once formed vast forests over much of the north of the country. Whereas now it is the wood of the<b> kauri </b>which is an important natural resource, in the past it was the tree’s<b> sap </b>(the thick liquid which flows inside a tree) which, when hardened into gum, <b><b>played an important</b> role</b> in <b>New Zealand</b>’s <b>early history</b>.","After running from rips or tears in the bark of trees, the<b> sap </b>hardens to form the<b> lumps </b>of gum which eventually fall to the ground and are buried under layers of forest litter. The bark often splits where branches fork from the trunk, and gum accumulates there also.","The <b>early European</b> settlers in <b>New Zealand</b> collected and sold the gum. Gum fresh from the tree was soft and of low value but most of the gum which was harvested had been buried for <b>thousands of years</b>. This gum came in a<b> bewildering </b>variety of colours, degree of<b> transparency </b>and hardness, depending on the length and location of burial, as well as the health of the original tree and the area of the bleeding. Highest quality gum was hard and bright and was usually found at shallow depth on the hills. Lowest quality gum was soft, black or chalky and sugary and was usually found buried in swamps, where it had been in contact with water for a <b>long time</b>. Long periods in the sun or bush fires could transform dull, cloudy<b> lumps </b>into <b>higher quality</b> transparent gum.","<b>B</b>","Virtually all <b>kauri gum</b> was found in the regions of <b>New Zealand</b> where<b> kauri </b>forests grow today – from the middle of the North Island northwards. In Maori and <b>early European</b> times <b>up until</b> 1850, most gum collected was simply <b>picked up</b> from the ground, but, after that, the majority was recovered by digging.","<b>C</b>","The original<b> inhabitants </b>of <b>New Zealand</b>, the Maori, had experimented with <b>kauri gum</b> well before <b>Europeans arrived</b> at the beginning of the <b>nineteenth century</b>. They called it kapia, and found it of considerable use.","Fresh gum from trees was prized for its chewing quality, as was buried gum when softened in water and mixed with the juice of a local plant. A piece of gum was often passed around from mouth to mouth when people gathered together until it was all gone, or when they tired of chewing, it was<b> laid </b>aside for future use.","<b>Kauri gum</b> burns readily and was used by Maori people to light fires. Sometimes it was bound in grass, ignited and used as a torch by night fishermen to attract fish.","<b>D</b>","The first <b>kauri gum</b> to be exported from <b>New Zealand</b> was part of a cargo taken back to Australia and England by two early expeditions in 1814 and 1815. By the 1860s, <b>kauri gum</b>’s reputation was <b>well established</b> in the<b> overseas </b>markets and European immigrants were joining the Maoris in collecting gum on the hills of northern <b>New Zealand</b>. As the surface gum became more scarce, spades were used to dig up the buried ‘treasure’. The <b>increasing number</b> of<b> diggers </b>resulted in <b>rapid growth</b> of the <b>kauri gum</b> exports from 1,000 tons in 1860 to a maximum of over 10,000 tons in 1900.","For <b>fifty years</b> from about 1870 to 1920, the <b>kauri gum</b> industry was a major <b>source of income</b> for settlers in northern <b>New Zealand</b>. As these would-be farmers struggled to break in the land, many turned to gum-digging to earn enough <b>money to support</b> their families and pay for improvements to their farms until better times arrived. By the 1890s, there were 20,000 people engaged in gum-digging. <b>Although many</b> of these, such as farmers, women and children, were only part-time diggers, nearly 7,000 were full-timers. During times of economic difficulty, gum-digging was the only job available where the unemployed from many walks of life could earn a living, if they were prepared to work.","<b>E</b>","The <b>first major</b> commercial use of <b>kauri gum</b> was in the manufacture of high-grade furniture varnish, a kind of clear paint <b>used to treat</b> wood. The best and<b> purest </b>gum that was exported prior to 1910 was used in this way. <b>Kauri gum</b> was used in 70% of the oil varnishes being manufactured in England in the 1890s. It was favoured ahead of other gums because it was easier to process at lower temperatures. The cooler the process could be kept the better, as it meant a paler<b> varnish </b>could be produced.","About 1910, <b>kauri gum</b> was found to be a very suitable ingredient in the production of <b>some kind</b>s of <b>floor coverings</b> such as linoleum. In this way, a use was found for the vast quantities of poorer quality and less pure gum, that had up till then been discarded as waste. <b>Kauri gum</b>’s importance in the manufacture of<b> varnish </b>and<b> linoleum </b>was displaced by<b> synthetic </b>alternatives in the 1930s.","<b>F</b>","Fossil <b>kauri gum</b> is rather soft and can be carved easily with a knife or<b> polished </b>with fine sandpaper. In the time of Queen Victoria of England (1837-1901), some pieces were made into fashionable amber beads that women wore around their necks. The occasional lump that contained<b> preserved </b>insects was prized for use in necklaces and bracelets. Many of the gum-diggers enjoyed the occasional spell of carving and produced a <b>wide variety</b> of small sculptured pieces. Many of these carvings can be seen today in local museums.","Over the years, <b>kauri gum</b> has <b>also been used</b> in a number of minor products, such as an ingredient in marine glue and candles. In the last decades, it <b>has had</b> a very limited use in the manufacture of extremely high-grade<b> varnish </b>for violins, but the gum of the magnificent<b> kauri </b>tree remains an <b>important part</b> of <b>New Zealand</b>’s history.","You will need to <b>fill in an application</b> for a passport in the following circumstances: if you are applying for a passport for the <b>first time</b>, if you wish to replace your current passport, if your passport has expired, or if it has been lost or stolen.

Now you need to prepare yourself for the interview to <b>make sure</b> you <b>make the most</b> of this opportunity. There are a number of <b>things you can do</b>.","<b>B.</b>   Firstly you can do <b>some research</b>. Find out about the employer and the job, ask for an information pack or speak to people you know who work for the company. Try to plan for the interview by asking who will be interviewing you and whether there will be a test to take.","<b>C.</b>  Prepare for questions you might be asked. Some common ones are the reason why you want the job, whether you <b>have done</b> this kind of work before, what your<b> strengths </b>and weaknesses are, and which leisure pursuits you enjoy.","<b>D.</b>   Another <b>important point</b> is never to run the risk of arriving late. For example, consider making a ‘dummy run’ in advance to see how long the journey will take. Check out <b>public transport</b> or, if you are going by car, the nearest parking. Aim to arrive about 10 minutes before the interview is <b>due to start</b>.","<b>E.</b>   It is also crucial to give plenty of thought to what you are going to wear. This will depend on the job you are going for.  There is no need to buy a new outfit, but aim to look neat and tidy. Remember, if you <b>look good</b> it will help you <b>feel good</b>.","<b>F.</b>   You <b>need to make</b> a good impression. Interviews can vary from a relatively informal ‘one-to-one’ chat to a very formal panel situation. Whatever the circumstances, you will <b>give yourself</b> an advantage by being friendly and polite, by making <b>eye contact</b> with the interviewer and by selling yourself by focusing on your strengths.","<b>G.</b>   There are also things you should avoid doing at your interview. <b>First of all</b>, don’t exaggerate. For example, if you don’t have the exact experience the employer is looking for, say so and explain you are willing to learn. Don’t simply give ‘yes’ and ‘no’ answers, but <b>answer questions</b> as fully as you can. And lastly, don’t forget to ask questions as well as answering them.","<b>H.</b>   One <b>final thing</b> to remember: it is important to show good team spirit, that you possess good people skills and that you are friendly and approachable. Finally, remember to be<b> enthusiastic </b>and show that you can be flexible.","{A} A<b> paradox </b>lies close to the heart of <b>scientific discovery</b>. If you know just what you are looking for, finding it can hardly count as a discovery, since it was fully anticipated. But if, on the other hand, you <b>have no</b> notion of what you are looking for, you cannot know when you <b>have found</b> it, and discovery, as such, is out of the question. In the<b> philosophy </b>of science, these extremes map onto the<b> purest </b>forms of deductivism and inductivism : In the former, the outcome is supposed to be logically contained in the premises you start with; in the latter, you are recommended to start with no expectations whatsoever and see what turns up.","{B} As in so many things, the ideal position is widely supposed to reside somewhere in between these two impossible-to-realize extremes. You <b><b>want to have</b> a good</b> enough idea of what you are looking for to be surprised when you <b><b>find some</b>thing</b> else of value, and you want to be ignorant enough of your end point that you can entertain alternative outcomes. <b>Scientific discovery</b> should, therefore, <b>have an accident</b>al aspect, but not <b>too much</b> of one.<b> Serendipity </b>is a word that expresses a position <b>something like</b> that. It’s a fascinating word, and the late Robert King Merton—the father of the sociology of science’—liked it well enough to compose its biography, assisted by the French cultural historian Elinor Barber.","{C}<b> Serendipity </b>means a “happy accident’ or ‘pleasant surprise’; specifically, the accident of finding something good or useful without looking for it. The first noted use of<b> serendipity </b>in the English language was by Horace Walpole (1717-1792). In a letter to Horace Mann (dated 28 January 1754) he said he formed it from the Persian fairy tale The Three Princes of Serendip, whose<b> heroes </b>‘were always making discoveries, by accidents and sagacity, of things they were not in quest of’. The name<b> stems </b>from Serendip, an old name for Sri Lanka.","{D} Besides antiquarians, the other community that came to dwell on<b> serendipity </b>to <b>say something</b> important about their practice was that of scientists. Many scientists, including the Harvard<b> physiologist </b>Walter Cannon and, later, the British immunologist Peter Medawar, liked to emphasize how much of <b>scientific discovery</b> was<b> unplanned </b>and even accidental. One of Cannon’s favorite examples of such<b> serendipity </b>is Luigi Galvani’s observation of the twitching of<b> dissected </b>frogs’ legs, hanging from a copper wire, when they accidentally touched an iron railing, leading to the discovery of ‘galvanismo; another is Hans Christian Orsted’s discovery of electromagnetism when he unintentionally brought a current-carrying wire parallel to a magnetic needle. The context in which scientific<b> serendipity </b>was most contested and had its greatest<b> resonance </b>was that connected with the idea of planned science. The serendipitists were not all<b> inhabitants </b>of academic ivory towers. Two of the great early-20th-century American pioneers of<b> industrial </b>research-Willis Whitney and Irving Langmuir, both of General Electric—made much play of serendipity, in the course of arguing against overly<b> rigid </b>research planning.","{E} Yet what Cannon and Medawar took as a benign method, <b>other scientists</b> found incendiary To say that science had a significant serendipitous aspect was taken by some as dangerous denigration. If <b>scientific discovery</b> were really accidental, then what was the special basis of expert authority?","{F} In this connection, the aphorism of choice came from no less an authority on <b>scientific discovery</b> than Louis Pasteur: “Chance favors the prepared mind.” Accidents may happen, and things may <b>turn up</b><b> unplanned </b>and unforeseen, as one is looking for something else, but the ability to notice such events, to see their potential bearing and meaning, to<b> exploit </b>their<b> occurrence </b>and make constructive use of them—these are the results of systematic mental preparation. What <b>seems like</b> an accident is just another form of expertise. On closer inspection, it is insisted, accident dissolves into sagacity","{G} In 1936, as a <b>very young</b> man, Merton wrote a seminal essay on “The Unanticipated Consequences of Purposive<b> Social </b>Action.” It is, he argued, the nature of<b> social </b>action that what one intends is rarely what one gets: Intending to provide resources for buttressing Christian religion, the natural<b> philosophers </b>of the Scientific Revolution<b> laid </b>the groundwork for secularism  <b>people want</b>ing to be alone with nature in Yosemite Valley wind up crowding <b>one another</b>. We just don’t know enough—and we can never know enough—to ensure that the past is an adequate guide to the future: Uncertainty about outcomes, even of our best-laid plans, is endemic. All<b> social </b>action, including that undertaken with the best evidence and formulated according to the most<b> rational </b>criteria, is uncertain in its consequences."]},{"name":"GRE/11-1","paragraph":["School Attendance Information for Parents/Carers Introduction","Receiving a good full-time education will give your child the <b>best possible</b> start in life.

But to do so in 11 days and without <b>any obvious</b> motivation, as this zebra population does, is quite extraordinary. On average their journey involves an exhausting round-trip of 588 km – between the Makgadikgadi salt pan area and the Okavango river – making it second only to the great<b> trek </b>undertaken by the zebra<b> herds </b>in the Serengeti <b>National Park</b>. However, what is even more incredible still in my view is that <b>until recently</b> it was completely unheard of.","<b>B.</b> ","Hattie Bartlam, a researcher, discovered this migration while she was tracking zebra groups, officially known as harems, by the Okavango River for her PhD, Each harem consists of a stallion and his seven or eight mares with<b> juvenile </b>foals. There is no loyalty between zebras beyond this<b> social </b>group, though<b> harems </b>often gather together into so-called herds. For her study, Hattie had planned to compare the small-scale movement patterns of 11 different zebra<b> herds </b>in the area.","<b>C.</b> ","In December, when the annual rains had transformed the roads into rivers, Hattie was, therefore, more than a little surprised when she checked the data sent by the radio collars she fits to the zebras she is tracking to find that six of the<b> harems </b>were 270 km away on the edge of the Makgadikgadi, a huge mineral-rich area where salt has collected over the years as water evaporates in the heat. Then, when the last of the<b> moisture </b>from the rains had disappeared in May the following year, five of those<b> harems </b>came wearily back to the Okavango. This raised the question: why, despite a plentiful supply of <b>food and water</b>, were the zebras being drawn eastwards to the salt pans? Even more difficult to understand was what made six of the groups travel so far, while the other five remained by the Okavango.","<b>D.</b> ","This discovery created quite a buzz in the research community. I decided to visit Hattie and she explained that a century ago the <b>large number</b> of Botswana’s zebra and<b> wildebeest </b>herds and the resulting competition for grass made migration essential. One of the migration tracks went from the Okavango to Makgadikgadi. But in the late 1960s, giant fences were <b>put up</b> to stop foot and mouth and other diseases spreading between wildlife and domestic cattle. One of these went across the migration track. Though the animals could get round the obstacle, each leg of their journey would now be 200 km longer – an impossible distance given the lack of permanent water on the extended route. Even today, with the fence gone (it was taken down in 2004), there is dangerously little <b>drinking water</b> to support the zebras on the return journey to the Okavango.","<b>E.</b> ","As a zebra can live up to 20 years, the migration must have skipped at least <b>one generation</b> during the 40 or so years that the fences were up. This prompts another question: it <b>has always</b> been assumed that the young of social<b> herbivores </b>like zebras learn<b> migratory </b>behaviour from their parents, so how did the latest generation learn when and where to go? Not from their parents, who were prevented from migrating. Did they follow an<b>other species</b>, such as elephants? We may never know.","<b>F.</b> ","Hattie’s data points to the conclusion that there are several zebra populations adopting different behaviour. The first, like the <b>vast majority</b> of the Okavango zebras, <b>take it easy</b>, spending the entire year by the river. The second group, 15,000-20,000 strong, work a bit harder. They divide their time between the Makgadikgadi salt pans and the Boteti River, which is reasonably nearby. They sometimes struggle to find water in the Boteti area during the dry season, often moving 30 km in search of fresh grazing. Their reward: the juicy grass around the Makgadikgadi after the rains. The final group of zebras, whose numbers are more modest (though as yet unknown), must surely be considered as among the <b>animal kingdom</b>’s most remarkable athletes. By moving between the Okavango and the salt pans, they enjoy the best of both worlds. But the price they pay is an extraordinary journey across Botswana.","<b>G.</b> ","<b>Endangered species</b> naturally tend to grab the headlines, so it’s refreshing for a relatively abundant animal like the zebra to be the centre of attention for once. Zebras are a vital part of the food chain: understanding their migration, in turn, helps us to<b> interpret </b>the movements of their predators, and Hattie’s <b>research has</b><b> shed </b>light on the impact of fences on<b> migratory </b>animals. So what triggered her interest in zebras? She explains that it is <b>easier to get</b> funding to study exciting <b>animals like</b> lions. Crucial as that undoubtedly is, she believes that<b> herbivores </b>like zebras are key to understanding any ecosystem. The <b>scientific community</b> is fortunate that <b>people like</b> Hattie are willing to take the hard option."]},{"name":"GRE/11-2","paragraph":["Over the last 20 years, the number of children being driven to school in England has doubled.

For example, go through your presentation in front of a colleague or relative. Think about who your audience is and what you want them to get out of the presentation. Think about content and style.","Go into the presentation room and try out any moves you may have to make, e.g. getting up from your chair and moving to the podium. Errors in the first 20 seconds can be very disorientating.","<b>Familiarise yourself</b> with the<b> electronic </b>equipment before the presentation and <b>also have</b> a backup plan in mind, should there be an unexpected problem like a power cut.","Dealing with presentation nervousness:","<b>A </b> certain amount of<b> nervousness </b>is vital for a good presentation. The added adrenaline will keep your faculties sharp and give your presentation skills extra force. This can, however, result in tension in the upper chest.<b> Concentrate </b>on your breathing. Slow it <b>right down</b> and this will relax you. Strangely, having something to <b>pick up</b> and put down tends to help you do this.","It may seem an odd idea, but we seem to fee! calmer when we engage in what’s<b> referred </b>to as a<b> displacement </b>activity, like clicking a pen or fiddling with jewellery. A limited amount of this will not be too obvious and can make you feel more secure at the start.","Interacting with your audience:","Think of your presentation as a conversation with your audience. They may not actually say anything, but make them feel consulted, questioned, challenged, then they will stay awake and attentive.","Engage with your present audience, not the one you have prepared for. Keep looking for reactions to your ideas and respond to them. If your audience doesn’t appear to be following you, <b>find another</b> <b>way to get</b> your ideas across. If you don’t interact, you might as well send a video recording of your presentation instead!","Structuring effective presentations:","Effective presentations are full of examples. These help your listeners to see more clearly what you mean. It’s quicker and more colourful.<b> Stick </b>to the point using <b>three or four</b> main ideas. For any subsidiary information that you cannot present in 20 minutes, try another medium, such as handouts.","End as if your presentation <b>has gone</b> well. Do this <b>even if you feel</b> you’ve presented badly. And anyway a good finish will get you some applause – and you deserve it!","How to get a job in journalism","You can <b>get a good</b> qualification in journalism, but what employers actually want is practical, rather than theoretical, knowledge. There’s no<b> substitute </b>for creating real stories that have to be handed in by strict deadlines. So write for your school magazine, then maybe try your hand at editing. Once you’ve done that for a while, start requesting internships in newspapers in the area. These are generally short-term and unpaid, but they’re definitely worthwhile, since, instead of providing you with money, they’ll teach you the skills that every twenty-first-century<b> journalist </b>has to have, like laying out articles, creating web pages, taking good digital pictures and so on.","Most reporters keep a copy of every story they’ve had published, from <b>secondary school</b> onwards. They’re called cuttings, and you need them to get a job — indeed a few<b> impressive </b>ones can be the deciding factor in whether you’re appointed or not. So start creating a portfolio now that will show off your developing talent.","It seems obvious – research is an <b>important part</b> of an effective job hunt. But it’s surprising how many would-be journalists do <b>little or no</b>ne. If you’re thorough, it can <b><b>help you decide</b> whether</b> the job you’re thinking about applying for is right for you. And nothing impresses an editor more than an applicant who knows a lot about the paper.","There are two more elements to an application – your covering letter and<b> curriculum </b>vitae. However, your CV is the thing that will attract an editor’s attention first, so get it right. The key words are brevity, (no more than one page) accuracy (absolutely no spelling or typing errors) and clarity (it should be easy to follow).","In journalism, good writing skills are essential, so it’s critical that the style of your letter is appropriate. And, <b>make sure</b> it conveys your love of<b> journalism </b>and your eagerness to <b>do the work</b>.","What is it like to run a large supermarket?","Jill Insley finds out","A: You can’t beat <b>really good</b> service. I’ve been shopping in the Thamesmead branch of supermarket chain Morrisons, in south-east London, and I’ve experienced at first hand, the store’s latest maxim for improving the shopping experience – help, offer, thank. This involves identifying customers who might need help, greeting them, asking what they need, providing it, thanking them and leaving them in peace. If they don’t look like they want help, they’ll be left alone. But if they’re standing looking lost and perplexed, a <b>member of staff</b> will approach them. Staff are expected to be friendly to everyone. My checkout assistant has certainly said something to amuse the woman in front of me, she’s smiling as she leaves. Adrian Perriss, manager of the branch, has discussed the approach with each of his 387 staff. He says it’s about recognising that someone needs help, not being a<b> nuisance </b>to them. When he’s in another store, he’s irritated by someone saying, ‘Can I help you?’ when he’s <b>only just</b> walked in to have a <b>quick look</b> at the products.","B: How anyone can be friendly and<b> enthusiastic </b>when they start work at<b> dawn </b>beats me. The store opens at 7 am, Monday to Saturday, meaning that some staff, including Perriss, have to be here at 6 am to <b>make sure</b> it’s clean, safe and stocked up for the morning rush. Sometimes he walks in at 6 am and thinks they’re <b>never going</b> to be ready on time, but they always are. There’s so much going on overnight – 20 <b>people working</b> on unloading three enormous trailers full of groceries.","C: Perriss has worked in supermarkets since 1982, when he became a<b> trolley </b>boy on a weekly salary of £76. ‘It was less money than my previous job, but I loved it. It was different and diverse. I was doing trolleys, portering, bread, cakes, dairy and general maintenance.’ After a period in the produce department looking after the <b>fruit and vegetables</b>, he was made produce manager, then assistant <b>store manager</b> before reaching the top job in 1998. This involved intensive training and assessment through the company’s future <b>store manager</b> programme, learning how to analyse and<b> prioritise </b>sales, wastage,<b> recruitment </b>and many <b>other issues</b>. Perriss’ first stop as the <b>store manager</b> was at a store which was closed soon afterwards, though he was not to blame.","D: Despite the disappointing start, his career went from strength to strength and he was <b>put in charge</b> of launching new stores and heading up a ‘concept’ store, where the then <b>new ideas</b> of preparing and cooking pizzas in store, having a proper florist and fruit and vegetable ‘markets’ were trialled. All Morrisons’ managers from the whole country spent <b>three days</b> there to see the new concept. That was <b>hard work</b>,’ he says, ‘long days, seven <b>days a week</b>, for about a year.’","E: Although he oversees a store with a large turnover, there is a strong practical aspect to Perriss’s job. As we walk around, he chats to <b>all the staff</b> while checking the layout of their counters and the quality of the produce. He examines the baking potato shelf and rejects three, one that has split virtually in half and two that are beginning to go green. He then pulls out a lemon that looks fine to me. When I ask why, he picks up a second lemon and says: ‘Close your eyes and just feel and <b>tell me</b> which you would keep.’ I do and realise that while one is firm and hard, the other is going a bit squashy.","F: Despite eagle-eyed Perriss pulling out fruit and vegetable that most of us would buy without a second thought, the wastage <b>each week</b> is tiny: produce worth £4,200 is <b>marked down</b> for a quick sale, and only £400-worth is scrapped. This, he explains, is down to Morrisons’ method of ordering, still done manually rather than by computer. Department heads <b>know exactly</b> how much they’ve sold that day and how much they’re likely to sell the next, based on sales records and allowing for influences such as the weather.","G: Perriss is in charge of 1,000 man-<b>hours a week</b> across the store. To help him, he has a key team of four, who each have direct<b> responsibility </b>for <b>different departments</b>. He is keen to hear what staff think. He recently held a ‘talent’ day, inviting employees interested in <b>moving to a new</b> job within the store to come and <b>talk to him</b> about why they thought they should be promoted, and discuss how to go about it. ‘We had twenty- three <b>people come</b> through the door, <b>people want</b>ing to talk about progression,’ he says. ‘What do they <b>need to do</b> to become a supervisor? Twenty-three people will be better <b>members of staff</b> as a result of that talk.’","H: His favourite department is fish, which has a four-meter-<b>long run</b> by Debbie and Angela, who are busy having a discussion about how to cook a particular fish with a customer. But it is one of just 20 or so departments around the store and Perriss admits the pressure of <b>making sure</b> he knows what’s happening on them all can be intense. ‘You <b>have to do</b> so much and there could be something wrong with <b>every single</b> one, <b>every day</b>,’ he says. ‘You’ve got to minimise those things and<b> shrink </b>them into perspective. You’ve got to love the job.’ This is what Perriss <b><b>certainly do</b>es</b>."]},{"name":"GRE/11-3","paragraph":["<h2>Summer activities at London’s Kew Gardens</h2>","<b>A.</b>    Climb up to the walkway among the trees, 18 metres above the ground, for a<b> spectacular </b>experience.

These are often interdependent, and when choosing the date <b>take into account</b> the timing of similar regular events which may clash. Also, consider holiday periods which may <b>mean that people</b> are away and so will not be <b>able to attend</b>.","When choosing a venue, check how easy it is to reach by train and plane etc. and the availability of parking for those driving. Visit the<b> venue </b>personally: consider the size of the main lecture hall and whether it is <b>big enough</b> for the anticipated number of delegates, then look into the potential of having breakout areas for separating into a number of groups for discussions. Then check whether there is a suitable<b> lounge </b>area for the tea/coffee breaks and an exhibition space for display stands if required.","Who","The <b>next stage</b> is to choose the speakers and invite them, <b>making sure</b> you give them ample notice so they are more likely to be available. Ask only those people that you know speak well. Do not try and speak yourself in addition to organising the conference, as this will be too demanding.","Contacting people","Let people know the date and<b> venue </b>by an early mailshot.

Reminding your boss of activities, special assignments you did, and projects you were in charge of helps him or her create a more accurate <b>performance appraisal</b>. Consider keeping notes of these on a <b>regular basis</b> to <b>make it easier</b> to provide the data when required.","Create a list of questions you would <b>like to discuss</b> during your appraisal. This one-on-<b>one time</b> with your boss is an<b> excellent </b><b>opportunity to ask</b> him or her about your role in the company, request any additional<b> responsibilities </b>you would like and clarify your priorities. But it is best to focus your attention around personal and professional improvements, rather than financial considerations, such as an increase in salary.","During the appraisal","Present a positive attitude as soon as you enter the appraisal room. This approach may lead to a more constructive discussion of review items. <b>Avoid taking</b> any negative assessments that are offered as a personal attack, but rather try to take them on board calmly, because if you put the failings right you will improve your performance. A realistic assessment of your<b> strengths </b>and weaknesses can be <b>one of the most</b> beneficial ways of helping you advance in the company.","After the appraisal","Create a list of personal goals based on your <b>performance appraisal</b>. Make the items detailed and measurable if possible. Send this list to your boss so he or she knows you took the appraisal seriously. Use this list to help achieve higher scores on your next <b>performance appraisal</b>.","<b>Six months</b> after the appraisal, ask for a mid-term review with your boss to discuss your progress. This session should be more relaxed and informal than the official review. Ask for more feedback to help you improve. Checking in with your boss helps him or her remember your dedication as far as your job is concerned, and may help remove any criticisms before they become a review point on your next formal appraisal.","Efforts to save a special bird – The Spoon-billed Sandpiper","<b>Last year</b> an <b>international team</b> of ornithologists<b> devised </b>a bold plan to rescue one of the world’s<b> rarest </b>birds – Gerrit Vyn reports","<b>A.</b>    At first glance, the spoon-billed sandpiper<b> resembles </b>other small<b> migratory </b>birds of the<b> sandpiper </b>family that breed across the Arctic. But it is the <b>only one</b> to <b>have developed</b> a<b> flattened </b>bill that<b> flares </b>out into a ‘spoon’ at the end, and that makes it special. If it becomes extinct, <b>thousands of years</b> of evolution will come to an end, which would be a real tragedy.","The bird’s Russian name, kulik-lopaten, means ‘shovel beak’, which is an apt description of a remarkable structure. The bill is 19 mm long and 10 mm wide near the tip and the edges are lined with sharp serrations, called papillae. <b>Theories have</b> varied as to how the bill functions; one suggestion is that the<b> sandpiper </b>sweeps it through the water in a similar fashion to its larger namesake, the spoonbill. But Nigel Clark, a leading authority on the sandpiper, says the comparison is misleading.","<b>B.</b>    Until a <b><b>few years</b> ago</b>, the spoon-billed<b> sandpiper </b><b>had never</b> been fully documented, which added to its fascination. But an air of<b> mystery </b>is not helpful if you’re a Critically <b>Endangered species</b>. So the organisation ‘Birds Russia’ decided to produce a photographic and audio record of this imperilled bird with the help of experts <b>round the world</b>. In May of <b>last year</b>, I joined the international expedition to one of the species’ last breeding strongholds in North-East Russia. The primary aim of the two-and-a-half month expedition, however, was to collect eggs from wild sandpipers; those eggs would then be<b> hatched </b>in<b> captivity </b>nearby. Later, the chicks would be<b> flown </b>to the Wildfowl and<b> Wetlands </b>Trust (WWT) headquarters at Slimbridge in the UK, in order to establish a small, self-sustaining population there. These birds would provide a ‘safety net’, an insurance policy against the wild birds<b> dying </b>out.","<b>C.</b>    You might wonder why <b>birds like</b> the spoon-billed<b> sandpiper </b>travel such great distances, about 8,000 km in total, from their wintering grounds on the tropical coasts of Bangladesh, Burma and Vietnam in South-East Asia to breed on the low land, commonly called tundra, in North-East Russia, but from the birds’ <b>point of view</b> it is worth it. Though they often arrive to find hostile,<b> wintry </b>weather while they are finding their<b> mates </b>and making their nests, there are relatively <b>few predators</b> there, and the abundance of insects that<b> emerge </b>during the brief but intense Arctic summer creates ideal conditions for raising their chicks.","<b>D.</b>    Two main factors are<b> responsible </b>for the sandpiper’s recent rapid decline: the ongoing destruction of stopover habitat on its <b>migration route</b> and<b> hunting </b>on its wintering grounds. The <b>development of new</b><b> industrial </b>cities is destroying former<b> tidal </b>areas, where<b> sandpipers </b>and other<b> migratory </b>birds used to rest and refuel.<b> Subsistence </b>hunting is certainly a<b> hazard </b>in some Asian countries, where hunters trap birds for food.<b> Conservationists </b>are targeting this problem with small-scale interventions. For example, hunters from 40 villages have been given alternative sources of income, such as cool boxes in which they can take fish to sell at markets, in return for a halt to the bird-netting.","<b>E.</b>    Once the expedition <b>team had</b> reached its destination, it was <b>seven days</b> before we spotted the first sandpiper. In the following days, more began to arrive and the males’ song was heard, advertising their<b> patches </b>of<b> territory </b>to potential mates.","As the<b> sandpipers </b>paired up, the song gave way to the quiet of egg-laying and incubation. In total nine nests were found. The <b>first one</b> was lost to a predator, along with the female attending it. This was a stark reminder of the<b> vulnerability </b>of a tiny population to natural events, such as storms or predation.","The team then selected donor nests and<b> transferred </b>the eggs to<b> specially </b>prepared incubators. They collected 20 eggs in all, taking entire clutches each time – it was early in the <b>breeding season</b>, so the females were likely to lay replacements. Then 50 days after our arrival, the moment arrived: I<b> witnessed </b>my first wild spoon-billed<b> sandpipers </b>hatch. I had been lying inside a wind-battered hide for 36 hours when ! saw the first tiny chicks<b> emerge </b>from the eggs. Having hidden a microphone near the nest, I could also just hear their first calls. Later, I watched them stumbling through the 15 cm-high jungle of grasses on comically oversized legs and feet. But my joy was tempered by concern. Difficulties on their <b>migration route</b> and in their wintering areas meant that other tiny <b>creatures like</b> these faced<b> immense </b>dangers.","<b>F.</b>    The complex rescue plan does give some grounds for hope. Young chicks were<b> flown </b>to WWT Slimbridge <b>last year</b> and again this summer. A high-tech biosecure unit <b>has been built</b> for them there, it is divided in two, with the older birds in one section and this year’s chicks in the other. To minimise the risk of infections, staff change into full-body overalls and rubber shoes and wash their hands before entering.<b> Hygiene </b>is crucial: even a single strand of human hair could harm the chicks by becoming twisted round their legs or bills. The rescue plan’s <b>final stage</b>, once the captive<b> flock </b>has <b>built up</b> sufficiently, will be to fly eggs back to Russia, to release the chicks there.

The wing (known as a canopy) is attached to a harness by lines, not dissimilar to a parachute. The harness is where the pilots sit – and they report that it outperforms a<b> parachute </b>in terms of comfort.","Is it safe?","Like sailing and deep-sea diving,<b> paragliding </b>is as safe as the person doing it. The big advantage is that it’s probably the slowest form of aviation, so if you do crash you’ll hit the ground quite gently!","Where do I learn?","There are lots of schools, mainly based<b> inland </b>by appropriate hills or mountains, and there are also schools on the coast near<b> spectacular </b>cliffs. These are <b>very attractive</b>, though the prospect of landing in the sea seems to dissuade beginners! All schools will show you within a <b>couple of days</b> how to inflate the canopy, launch and land. They use radio instruction, tandem flying practice and schoolroom theory sessions to <b>help you get</b> the most from paragliding. It takes about seven <b>days to get</b> your basic licence; then you’re free to fly independently at sites across Australia.","What <b>do I need</b>?","Pilots normally wear warm clothes, in case they get <b>very high</b> up, and a helmet in case they stumble on landing. In terms of gear, schools supply basic training, canopies, harnesses, etc. However, you’ll probably want to buy your own more<b> sophisticated </b>equipment, which you’ll be able to choose <b>much better</b> once you’ve tried some out on your course.","Who can do it?","There’s no upper age limit provided your instructor deems you capable, but the youngest anybody can paraglide is 14. Anybody with good eyesight and good balance is a potential<b> paraglider </b>pilot. It’s a very relaxed sport as you’re mostly sitting down. You’ll probably experience pain in some muscles you didn’t know you had<b> whilst </b>learning, but many of those will be due to the walk up the training hill to launch. Flying a<b> paraglider </b>is a great sport. We hope to see you in the air with us this season!","How to prepare for an interview","Why prepare?","There are three <b>main reason</b>s..","One:     Although you can’t guess every question you might be asked, if you are prepared you can tailor your answers to fit.","Two:     If you’re <b>well prepared</b>, you will have more confidence and this will <b>affect the way</b> you come across.","Three:   Attitude matters. Prospective employers will choose a not-quite-perfect but willing candidate over a brilliant one who obviously isn’t bothered.","What to prepare?","Find out about the organisation","•    Visit the website and <b>read any</b> materials that you have been sent. If nothing has been sent, phone the company to ask for any reading matter they may have.","•    Talk to anyone you know who works there already.","Find out about the job","•    Ask for a job description or specification. This will tell you the duties that go with the job.","•    Talk to anyone you know who is familiar with the work you may be doing.","Find out what the employer is looking for","•    <b>Make a list</b> of the skills specified in the job advertisement.","•    Think of examples to back up claims that you have these skills.","You can then answer most of the questions that will <b>come up</b>, such as ‘<b>Tell me</b> more about how you work in a team’.","Add in a few ‘lessons learned’ – what you did and how you might <b>have done</b> it better. You can also outline any voluntary work you <b>have done</b> for a charity, or <b>any experience</b> of paid work in an<b> unrelated </b>sector.","Preparing for <b>other kinds</b> of questions","Interviewers are also looking for someone who is likely to stay with the organisation and progress within it.

Start by thinking about who your target customers are. Are they people who live locally? Are they a particular <b>group of people</b>?","Now look at your competitors. What is different about what you will be doing and how will you <b>persuade people</b> to come to you <b>instead of going</b> to someone who is <b>already established</b>?","How will you reach the customers?","Will you promote your product by phoning people, or visiting local traders, or advertising in magazines or online? Will your delivery system be direct or through shops?","How will your business work?","<b>Now think</b> about what your business needs to succeed. Do you <b>need to look</b> for premises or can you <b>work from home</b>? <b>Do you need</b> to invest in manufacturing equipment to start with?","Is the business something chat you can do on your own, or if you get more work will you be looking to<b> recruit </b>staff? If so, what skills would they need?","Whether you’re a sole operator or are looking to<b> recruit </b>a team, effective management is essential.","The law regulates how companies are run and you <b>need to set</b> aside the time to see that this is done properly, in relation to issues like accounting, insurance and tax.","The money!","As you are working our die prices for your products, you <b><b>need to make</b> sure</b> you build in all your costs.

Even in these days of agricultural intensification, the<b> hare </b>is still to be seen in open countryside, but its numbers are falling.","<b>A.</b>  <b>Like many</b> herbivores, <b>brown hares</b> spend a relatively <b>large amount</b> of their time feeding. They prefer to do this in the dark, but when nights are short, their <b>activities do</b><b> spill </b>into daylight hours. Wherever they live,<b> hares </b>appear to have a fondness for fields with a variety of vegetation, for example, short as well as longer clumps of grasses. <b>Studies have</b> demonstrated that they benefit from<b> uncultivated </b>land and other unploughed areas on farms, such as field margins. Therefore, if farmers provided<b> patches </b>of woodland in areas of pasture as well as assorted crops in arable areas, there would be year-round shelter and food, and this could be the key to turning round the current decline in<b> hare </b>populations.","<b>B.</b>  <b>Brown hares</b> have a number of physical adaptations that enable them to survive in open countryside. They have exceptionally large ears that move independently, so that a range of sounds can be pinpointed accurately. Positioned high up on their heads, the hares’ large golden eyes give them 360° vision, making it hard to take a<b> hare </b>by surprise. Compared to mammals of a similar size,<b> hares </b><b>have a great</b>ly enlarged heart and a higher volume of blood in their bodies, and this allows for<b> superior </b>speed and stamina. In addition, their legs are longer than those of a rabbit, enabling<b> hares </b>to run more like a dog and reach speeds of up to 70 kph.","<b>C.</b>  <b>Brown hares</b> have<b> unusual </b>lifestyles for their large size, breeding from a <b>young age</b> and producing many<b> leverets </b>(babies). There are about three litters of <b>up to four</b><b> leverets </b><b>every year</b>. Both males and females are able to breed at about seven months old, but they have to be quick because they seldom live for more than <b>two years</b>. The <b>breeding season</b> runs from January to October, and by late February most females are pregnant or giving birth to their first<b> litter </b>of the year. So it seems strange, therefore, that it is in March, when the <b>breeding season</b> is already underway, that<b> hares </b>seemingly go mad: boxing, dancing, running and fighting. This <b>has given</b> rise to the age-old<b> reference </b>to ‘mad March hares’. In fact, boxing occurs throughout the <b>breeding season</b>, but people <b>tend to see</b> this behaviour more often in March. This is because in the succeeding months,<b> dusk </b>– the time when<b> hares </b>are <b>most active</b> – is later, when <b>fewer people</b> are about. Crops and<b> vegetation </b>are also taller, hiding the<b> hares </b>from view. Though it is often thought that they are males fighting over females, boxing<b> hares </b>are usually females fighting off males.<b> Hares </b>are mostly solitary, but a female fights off a series of males until she is ready to mate. This occurs <b>several times</b> through the <b>breeding season</b> because, as soon as the female <b>has given</b> birth, she will be ready to mate again.","<b>D.</b>  But how can females manage to do this while<b> simultaneously </b>feeding themselves and rearing their young? The reason is that<b> hares </b><b>have evolved</b> such self-sufficient young. Unlike baby rabbits,<b> leverets </b>are born<b> furry </b>and mobile. They weigh about 100 g at birth and are immediately left to their own devices by their mothers. A <b>few days</b> later, the members of the<b> litter </b>creep away to create their own individual resting places, known as ‘forms’. Incredibly, their mother visits them only <b>once every</b> 24 hours and, even then, she only suckles them for a maximum of <b>five minutes</b> each. This lack of family contact may seem harsh to us, but it is a strategy that draws less attention from predators. At the tender age of <b>two weeks</b>,<b> leverets </b>start to feed themselves, while still drinking their mother’s milk. They grow<b> swiftly </b>and are fully weaned at four weeks, reaching adult weight at about <b>six months</b>.","<b>E.</b>  <b><b>Research has</b> shown</b> that hares’ milk is extremely rich and fatty, so a little goes a <b>long way</b>. In order to produce such<b> nutritious </b>milk, females need a high-quality, high-calorie diet.<b> Hares </b>are selective feeders at the best of times: <b>un<b>like many</b></b> herbivores, they can’t sit around waiting to digest low-quality food – they need high- energy<b> herbs </b>and other leaves in order to sprint. This causes them problems when faced with the smallest alterations in food availability and abundance. So, as well as reductions in the diversity of farmland habitat, the decline in the range of food plants is injurious to hares.","<b>F.</b>  The rapid turnaround in the breeding cycle suggests that<b> hares </b>should, in principle, be able to increase their populations quickly to<b> exploit </b>new habitats. They certainly used to: <b>studies show</b> that<b> hares </b>evolved on the open plains and spread rapidly westward from the Black Sea after the <b><b>last ice</b> age</b> (though they were probably introduced to Britain as a<b> species </b>to be hunted for the pot by the Romans). But today’s<b> hares </b>are thwarted by the lack of rich farmland habitat. When the delicate<b> herbs </b>and <b>other plants</b> they rely on are ploughed up or<b> poisoned </b>by herbicides, these wonderful, agile runners disappear too, taking with them some of the wildness from our lives."]},{"name":"GRE/12-1","paragraph":["<h2>Big Rock Climbing Centre</h2>","<b>Big Rock</b> Climbing Centre is modern, friendly professionally run centre offering over 1,200 square metres of fantastic indoor climbing.

So if you‘re advertising where they’re just not looking, it’s wasted money. That’s why it pays to <b>do a bit</b> of research. <b>Every time</b> someone contacts your company, ask them where they found out about you. And act on this information so you’re advertising in the right places.","Always think like a customer","What makes your customers tick? Find out, and you’re halfway to saying the <b>right thing</b>s in your advertising. So <b>take the time</b> to ask them. A simple phone or email survey of your own customers, politely asking why they use you, what they <b>really like</b> and what they don’t, is invaluable.","<b>Make sure</b> customers know you’re there","If a customer can‘t see you, they can‘t buy from you. There are loads of<b> opportunities </b>to promote your business — print, press, direct mail, telemarketing, email and the internet — and using a mix of these increases your chances of being seen (and remembered).","Ignore your customers and they’ll go away","It sounds obvious, but companies who talk to their customers have <b>much better</b><b> retention </b>rates than those that don’t, so it’s worth staying in touch. Capture your customers’ email addresses upfront. Follow up a transaction to check they’re <b>happy with the service</b> and, if possible, send them updates that are helpful,<b> informative </b>and relevant.","Know what works (and what doesn’t)","Do what the professionals do, and measure all your advertising. That’ll tell you what you’re doing right — and where there’s room for improvement. You never know, it might just throw up <b>some information</b> that could change your business for the better.","Remember word-of-mouth: the best advertising there is","<b>A </b> recent survey found that consumers are 50% more likely to be inﬂuenced by word-of-mouth recommendations than by TV or radio ads. So your reputation is your <b>greatest asset</b> If your current customers are impressed with your company, they’ll be more inclined to recommend you to others. On the ﬂip side, if they experience bad service they probably won’t complain to you — but you can be sure they will to their friends.","<b>A </b> brief history of automata","An automation is a machine, usually made to resemble a person or animal, that operates on its own, once it has been started. Although few are constructed nowadays, they have a history stretching back well over two <b>thousand years</b>. Several<b> myths </b>show that the <b><b>ancient Greek</b>s</b> were interested in the creation of automata. In one, Hephaestus, the god of all mechanical arts, was reputed to <b>have made</b> two female<b> statues </b>of pure gold which assisted him and accompanied him wherever he went. As well as giving<b> automata </b>a place in mythology, the Greeks <b>almost certainly</b> created some. These were probably activated by levers and powered by human action, although there are descriptions of steam and water being used as <b>sources of power</b>.<b> Automata </b>were sometimes intended as toys, or as tools for demonstrating basic scientiﬁc principles.","Other ancient cultures, too, seem to <b>have developed</b> automata. In Egypt, Ctesibius experimented with air pressure and pneumatic principles. One of his creations was a singing blackbird powered by water. A Chinese text of the third century BC describes a life-size, human-shaped ﬁgure that could walk rapidly, move its head <b>up and down</b>, sing and wink its eye.","Much later, Arab engineers of the ninth and thirteenth centuries wrote detailed treatises on how to build programmable musical fountains, mechanical servants, and<b> elaborate </b>clocks. A ninth-century ruler in Baghdad had a silver and gold tree with metal birds that sang. The art of creating<b> automata </b>developed considerably during the ﬁfteenth century, linked with improvements in clock making: the mechanisms of<b> automata </b>and clocks had a <b>great deal</b> in common. Some truly remarkable<b> automata </b>were produced at this time. Muller was reputed to <b>have made</b> an artiﬁcial eagle which ﬂew to greet the<b> Emperor </b>on his entry into Nuremberg, Germany, in 1470, then returned to<b> perch </b>on top of a city gate and, by stretching its wings and bowing, saluted the<b> emperor </b>on his arrival. <b>Leonardo da</b> Vinci made a lion in honour of the king of France, which advanced towards him, stopped, opened its chest with a claw and pointed to the French coat of arms.","Automata were normally <b>very expensive</b> toys for the very rich. They were made for royal or aristocratic patrons, to be viewed only by themselves and selected guests – who were expected to be impressed by their wealth.<b> Automata </b>were also created for public show, however, and many appeared on clock towers, such as me one in Bern, Switzerland, built in 1530.","During the <b>eighteenth century</b>, some watchmakers made<b> automata </b>to contribute to the progress of medicine and the natural sciences, particularly to investigate the mechanical laws governing the structure and movement of living things. Many of their creations simulated almost perfectly the complex structure of <b>human beings</b> and animals. Maillardet made extensive use of<b> gearing </b>and<b> cogs </b>to produce<b> automata </b>of horses, worked by turning a handle. Vaucanson produced a duck made of gilded copper which ate,<b> drank </b>and quacked like a real duck. He <b>also made</b> a life-size Female <b>flute player</b>. Air passes through the complex mechanism, causing the lips and ﬁngers of the player to move naturally on the flute, opening and closing holes on it. This automation had a<b> repertoire </b>of twelve tunes.","In another well—known piece, Merlin’s silver swan made in 1773, the swan sits in a stream consisting of glass rods where small silver ﬁsh are swimming. When the<b> clockwork </b>is wound, a music box plays and the glass rods rotate, giving the impression of a ﬂowing stream. The swan turns its head from side to side. lt soon notices the ﬁsh and bends down to catch and. eat one, then raises its head to the upright position. The mechanism still works.","<b>One of the most</b> skilled makers of<b> automata </b>was the Swiss watchmaker jaquet-Droz. He produced three<b> automata </b>which, even today, are considered wonders of science and mechanical engineering. One of these, The Writer, simulates a boy sitting at a desk, dipping his pen into the ink and writing perfectly legibly.","Another<b> Stunning </b>creation of the <b>eighteenth century</b> was the Mechanical Theatre in the grounds of Austria’s Hellbrunn Palace, home of the Archbishop of Salzburg. Designed by the miner Rosenegger, and completed in 1752, this depicts the nobility’s idea of a perfect society, with every class in its proper place. The ﬁgures inside a palace depict eighteenth- century court life, while industrious activity is carried on in and around this building. A total of 141 mobile and 52<b> immobile </b>little ﬁgures demonstrate all manner of trades of the period: building workers bring materials to the foreman, who drinks; butchers slaughter an ox; a barber shaves a man. A dancing bear performs, guards march past the palace, a farmer pushes an old woman in a wheelbarrow over the road. The theatre shows great skill in clock making and water technology, consisting of hidden waterwheels, copper wiring and cogwheels.","During the <b>nineteenth century</b>, mass production techniques meant that<b> automata </b>could be made cheaply and easily, and they became toys for children rather than an expensive adult amusement. Between 1860 and 1910, small family businesses in Paris made thousands of<b> clockwork </b>automata and mechanical singing birds and exported them a<b>round the world</b>. However, the <b>twentieth century</b> saw traditional forms of<b> automata </b>fall out of favour.","Working Time Regulations for Mobile Workers","These rules apply to drivers and crew of heavy <b>goods vehicles</b> or public service vehicles.

Before the arrival of the railways in the 19th century, water transportation was the most efﬁcient means of <b>moving heavy</b> or bulk freight, and the Humber, situated at the heart of the waterway system associated with the <b>two major</b> rivers, was one of the chief highways of England. its trafﬁc brought prosperity to the settlements on its banks, particularly the city of<b> Hull </b>on its north bank, but the river itself tended to cut them off from some of their closest neighbours, as well as obstructing the progress of travellers moving north or south.","<b>B.</b> ","To cater for these local and, as time progressed, wider needs,<b> ferries </b>were provided across many of the streams ﬂowing into the Humber, and in 1315, a<b> ferry </b>was established across the Humber itself between<b> Hull </b>and Lincolnshire. By 1800, this<b> ferry </b><b>had become</b> fully integrated into the overland <b>transport system</b>, but the changes associated with the <b>industrial revolution</b> were soon to threaten its position. Increased trafﬁc encouraged speculators to establish rival<b> ferries </b>between<b> Hull </b>and Lincolnshire, notably a service between<b> Hull </b>and <b>New Holland</b> which opened in 1826. This crossing was considerably shorter than on the existing<b> Hull </b>to Barton service, which closed in 1851, unable to cope with the increased competition from the<b> rival </b>service.","The <b>New Holland</b> <b>ferry service</b> then grew into a major link between the north and south banks of the Humber, carrying passengers, and cattle and goods bound for<b> Hull </b>Market. In 1968, there was brieﬂy a <b>ferry service</b> from Grimsby to<b> Hull </b>involving hovercrafts. This did not <b>last long</b> as the<b> hovercrafts </b>could not cope with the demands of the River Humber. The <b>ferry service</b> between<b> Hull </b>and <b>New Holland</b> ended with the opening of the Humber Bridge in 1981.","<b>C.</b> ","The bridge was the outcome of over 100 <b>years of campaigning</b> by local interests for the construction of a bridge or<b> tunnel </b>across the estuary. The <b>first major</b> crossing proposal was a<b> tunnel </b>scheme in 1872. This scheme was promoted by<b> Hull </b>merchants and businesses dissatisﬁed with the serviice provided by the <b>New Holland</b><b> ferry </b>crossing. Over the next 100 years, a variety of proposals were put forward in an effort to bridge the Humber. In 1928, a plan was <b>drawn up</b> by<b> Hull </b><b>City Council</b> to build a multi-span bridge four miles west of Hull. However, the scheme was dropped after being hit by the ﬁnancial woes of the Great<b> Depression </b>of the late 1920s and early 1930s.","<b>D.</b> ","Government approval for the construction of a <b>suspension bridge</b> was ﬁnally granted in 1959, although it was not until 1973 that work ﬁnally began. The reasons why a <b>suspension bridge</b> was chosen were twofold. Firstly, the Humber has a shitting bed, and the navigable channel along which a<b> craft </b>can travel is always changing; a <b>suspension bridge</b> with no support piers in mid-stream would not obstruct the estuary. Secondly, because of the<b> geology </b>and topography of the area, the cost of constructing a<b> tunnel </b>would have been excessive.","<b>E.</b> ","Work on the construction proceeded for eight years, during which time many thousands of tonnes of<b> steel </b>and concrete were used and upwards of one thousand workers and staff were employed at times of peak activity. The <b>designers had</b> been<b> responsible </b>for two other major <b>suspension bridge</b>s in Britain but, with a total span of 2,220 m, or almost a mile and a half, the Humber was going to be the longest <b>suspension bridge</b> in the world. Nowadays designers have computers, but back then everything was done with slide rules and calculators. The towers were concrete rather than the usual steel, since concrete was cheaper and would<b> blend </b>in better with the setting. The bridge was designed to stand for 120 years.","<b>F.</b> ","Malcolm Stockwell, the bridgemaster, recalls that when the bridge ﬁrst opened, there wasn’t a <b>great deal</b> of interest in it. Then children started visiting, and he remembers their astonishment at seeing the control room and all the lights. People who lived in towns on<b> opposite </b>banks a mile apart started crossing the river — a journey that previously might as well have been to the moon. The bridge brought them together. .","<b>G.</b> ","The bridge opened up, both<b> socially </b>and economically, two previously remote and<b> insular </b>areas of England, and the improvement in communication enabled the area to realise its potential in commercial,<b> industrial </b>and tourist development. The bridge has saved <b>many millions</b> of<b> vehicle </b>miles and many valuable hours of drivers’ and passengers’ time – an <b>important factor</b> not only for the drivers and operators of commercial vehicles, but also for tourists and holidaymakers who would <b>have had</b> to travel around the<b> estuary </b>to reach destinations in the region. ln the words of Malcolm Stockwell, ‘Although it can’t beat the <b>Golden <b>Gate Bridge</b></b> in <b>San Francisco</b> for setting, it far outstrips it for<b> sheer </b>elegance and as a piece of engineering.’","<b>A </b> Cooking for today","These are classes for those of you who can already make basic meal by keeping strictly to a simple recipe, but who would now like to use your imagination as well.

According to research published in Science last November, stocks of all the fish and<b> shellfish </b>that we currently eat will collapse before 2050. Or at least that’s how the media reported it.","<b>B</b>","However the scientist who led the study has said that the main conclusion of his <b>research has</b> been buried beneath the headlines. While the danger to our seafood supply is real enough, says Boris Worm, assistant professor of marine conservation biology at Dalhousie University, Canada, there is a more serious point: that the way in which we manage the oceans is not only<b> threatening </b>the survival of individual species, it’s upsetting the <b>delicate balance</b> of marine communities and thus causing the collapse of entire ecosystems. <b><b>Research has</b> shown</b> that the number of ecosystems where all higher forms of life are extinct, so-called dead zones is increasing.","The point that many reports failed to highlight, says Worm, is that we have to <b>revolutionise the way</b> our <b>marine resources</b> are run, changing the focus from stocks and<b> quotas </b>to biodiversity and ecosystem protection. And to do that, we must <b>change the way</b> the debate about our <b>marine resources</b> is conducted in the public domain.","<b>C</b>","Around 7,500 <b>years ago</b>,<b> shrinking </b>glaciers and the resulting higher water levels <b>led to the development</b> of what’s called the Wadden Sea, a 13,500-square-kilometre area of the North Sea. <b>During the first</b> 5,000 years or so, the sea pulsated with life. There was a <b>high level</b> of biodiversity on the<b> seabed </b>too, and the salt marshes and mud flats on the coast supported millions of birds. This continued until around 2,000 <b>years ago</b>, when human pressure began to affect it. <b><b>Research has</b> shown</b> that some of the larger creatures disappeared more than 500 <b>years ago</b>. And by the late","19th century, populations of most of the other mammals and fish were<b> severely </b>reduced, leading to the collapse of several traditional fisheries.","<b>D</b>","What’s interesting is that<b> overfishing </b>isn’t the main agent of the decline, as we might assume. It’s due to an ongoing combination of exploitation, <b>habitat destruction</b> and pollution. Coastal development, for example, destroys <b>large areas</b> of<b> wetlands </b>that support a range of species.<b> Pollution </b>fuels a process known as eutrophication, which kills certain seagrasses. Nutrients such as<b> nitrogen </b>and phosphorus contained in human and<b> industrial </b>waste promote the growth of tiny phytoplankton. This over-enrichment of the sea can ultimately lead to the collapse of the entire system through<b> oxygen </b>starvation.","Most marine ecosystems have an in-built capacity to deal with a certain <b>amount of pollution</b> because<b> shellfish </b>can absorb phytoplankton. But in many cases, these have been largely removed by fishing, so the effect of any nutrient-rich<b> pollutants </b>entering the system is increased. In a healthy system, coastal<b> wetlands </b>also act as filters, so their destruction causes even more pollution. These processes have been fairly well understood for a <b>number of years</b>.","<b>E</b>","What the Science paper has demonstrated, however, is that the decline in the health of ecosystems is greater where the <b>number of different</b><b> species </b>is low. The population of marbled rock<b> cod </b>around the South Atlantic island of South Georgia, for example, <b>still has</b>n’t recovered after the <b>fishing industry</b> caused its collapse during the 1970s. By contrast, North Sea<b> cod </b>has<b> withstood </b>very heavy fishing for <b>hundreds of years</b>, says Worm, and although it has declined substantially, it hasn’t yet collapsed completely. Worm believes that, ‘to have a <b>greater number</b> of<b> species </b>makes an ecosystem more robust’. His theory is backed up by evidence from experiments into how ecosystems react to change.","<b>F</b>","And <b>some positive</b> <b>news came</b> from the study. Worm and his colleagues were able to show that it’s possible to reverse such damage as long as there are enough species. A survey of 44 <b>protected areas</b> revealed increases in biodiversity and fish catches close to the reserves. Worm says, ‘We should be focusing our attention on protecting all of our <b>marine resources</b> at the ecosystem level, and managing levels of fishing,<b> pollution </b>and habitat<b> disturbance </b>to ensure that crucial services that maintain the health of the ecosystem continue to function.’ To anyone who knows anything about ecology, it would appear that Worm is just stating the obvious. And many <b>protected areas</b> on land are now managed in this way.","<b>G</b>","However, there <b>has long</b> been a<b> tendency </b>to view our oceans as a limitless resource, combined with a widespread failure to make an emotional connection with most marine wildlife. True, we have created a <b>small number</b> of marine <b>protected areas</b>. ‘We <b>seem to have</b> understood the value of protecting ecosystems in <b>areas such</b> as the Australian Great Barrier Reef that we consider to be particularly beautiful/ says John Shepherd, Professor of Marine Sciences at Southampton <b>University in the UK</b>. ‘Human nature will always draw us towards those<b> species </b>or<b> habitats </b>that are more aesthetically pleasing. That’s why there will always be support for protecting pandas and <b>very little</b> for worms, <b>even though</b> nematodes play a <b>vital role</b> in maintaining the health of an ecosystem.’","<b>A </b> Whitehay Youth Music is intended for anyone aged between 6 and 14 who is keen to perform in public.

Encourage them to ask questions to clarify anything that may be uncertain, and to always come to you whenever something seems to be out of place or going wrong. Clear communication is critical.","<b>Make sure</b> the whole team and the client company grasp the project’s limitations in terms of its achievable outcomes. You can finish a task successfully and on time as long as expectations are reasonable.","3. Staying on track","How can you know if your project is going to be successful if you don’t <b>have any</b> way of measuring success? You will need interim milestones, especially for a long-term project, so that you can determine if you are staying on track or straying from the project’s goals.","4. Manage project risks","Hopefully you have defined the more likely risks up front during the project preparation, so you should now put contingency plans in place for certain occurrences. If you can see when a risk is imminent, you can take preventive action to avoid it, but be ready to halt a project if the risk becomes unacceptable.","5. Evaluate the project","Once a <b>project has</b> been completed, it’s important to <b>write a report</b>, even if it is only for internal purposes. You can pinpoint what went right or wrong, determine what could <b>have been done</b> differently, and establish the best practices for use in future undertakings.","Mass<b> appeal </b>of the <b>manta rays</b>","<b>A </b> I am underwater, <b>face to face</b> with a large flat fish which I recognise immediately as being a<b> manta </b>ray. For an instant I look<b> straight </b>into its gaping mouth and see the row of small,<b> flattened </b>teeth in its lower jaw. Close on its tail comes another<b> manta </b>ray, and another and another. The <b>manta rays</b> are unaffected by my being there, cruising past in a leisurely fashion without seeming to expend any great effort.","<b>B </b> From above, the <b>manta rays</b> are <b>great black</b><b> silhouettes </b>that fishermen called ‘devil fish’, because of the<b> curious </b>horn-like fins hanging down near their mouths. But looking into their eyes you get a sense of their peaceful nature. Unlike stingrays,<b> mantas </b>don’t have venomous spines in their tails, and <b>un<b>like many</b></b> fish<b> species </b>they seem to enjoy human company. Once, over-enthusiastically, I swim towards a manta. I am <b>just a few</b> inches away when it senses me. To my surprise, the whole fish twitches in alarm and<b> shoots </b>off, perhaps fearing that I will touch it. I feel ashamed to <b>have given</b> it a fright.","<b>C </b> I <b>have come</b> to Hanifaru, a small<b> lagoon </b>next to an uninhabited island in the Maldives, especially to see <b>manta rays</b>. These great harmless creatures congregate here during the south-west<b> monsoons </b>between May and November and, if the tides and winds are right, enter a shallow cul-de-sac in the reef to hunt for plankton, their <b>main source</b> of nutrition. On certain days the bay can attract more than 100 mantas. I <b>have seen</b> many <b>manta rays</b> on dives a<b>round the world</b>, though not in these numbers.","<b>D </b> Guy Stevens is my guide, a British marine biologist who has been studying the<b> mantas </b>for the past <b>five years</b>. Based at the nearby <b>Four Seasons</b> resort, he <b>has identified</b> more than 2,000 individual <b>manta rays</b>, photographing and<b> cataloguing </b>them according to their distinctive skin patterns. <b>Each day</b> we make the 40-minute boat journey from the<b> resort </b>to Hanifaru. Feeding events, as Guy calls them, are never guaranteed, but, during the season, hotel guests can <b>sign up</b> for ‘manta alerts’. If Guy and his research assistants spot significant<b> manta </b>activity, the guests will be brought by fast speedboat to the<b> lagoon </b>to snorkel. When feeding, the<b> mantas </b>of Hanifaru tend to stay near the surface, making them accessible to snorkellers just as much as divers. They seem not to mind the human competition in this <b>quite small</b> space, and indeed they are often joined by other rays and even giant whale sharks, which feed on the same plankton.","<b>E </b> Word among the diving community about the possibility of finding a mass of <b>manta rays</b> at Hanifaru has slowly been spreading over the past year. Outside the shallow<b> lagoon </b>I can see five large safari boats – live-aboard cruisers that take divers around the best underwater sites in the Maldives. It is something that Guy has been monitoring closely. ‘Word is out that Hanifaru is a top<b> manta </b>spot,’ he explains, ‘and although the government has declared the bay a “protected area”, we still don’t <b>have any</b> regulations in force to limit the <b>number of people</b> in the water at any <b>one time</b>.’","<b>F </b> During my stay, the<b> resort </b>received a visit from the then-president of the Maldives, Mohamed Nasheed. Since coming to power in 2008, he <b>had made</b> his interest in the marine environment and concerns about <b>climate change</b> <b>well known</b>. In 2009 he held an underwater cabinet meeting, urging other world leaders to act decisively to combat <b>climate change</b>. The protection of wildlife <b>areas such</b> as Hanifaru was clearly one of his objectives, and I asked him why he took such an interest. ‘Maldivians have lived with the reefs and their fish life since long before there were tourists,’ he said. ‘And while tourist dollars are good for our country, the sea and its produce are even more vital to my people. I have to balance what tourists <b>want to see</b> with<b> preserving </b>the marine environment – and in <b>some cases</b>, like Hanifaru, those objectives coincide.’","<b>G </b> On several dives I am lucky enough to get close to the mantas, sometimes at underwater ‘cleaning stations’. Here, the<b> mantas </b>come in <b>small number</b>s, or individually, to pause above a coral<b> outcrop </b>and wait while small fish pick at their skin, removing parasites. Adapted for fast swimming with their<b> flattened </b>bodies, they can accelerate rapidly with a twitch of their wings. They gaze at human swimmers with a kind of knowing calm, <b>something people</b> often remark on when they try to capture the emotion they experience after seeing them.

In these cases, the employer should consider what reasonable adjustments could be made in the workplace to help the employee. This might be <b>something as simple</b> as supplying an appropriate chair for the use of the employee. In cases where an employee suffers from an allergy caused by something in the workplace, the employer should consider remedial action or a transfer to alternative work.","If the absence is because of<b> temporary </b>difficulties relating to dependants, the employee may be<b> entitled </b>to <b>have time</b> off under the<b> provisions </b>of the Employment Rights Act 1996. In cases where the employee <b>has difficulty</b> managing both work and home responsibilities, employees <b>have the right</b> to request flexible ways of working, such as job-sharing, and employers must <b><b>have a go</b>od</b> business reason for rejecting any such application.","Employers should investigate unexpected absences promptly and the employee should be asked for an explanation at a return-to-work interview. In order to show both the employee concerned and <b>other employees</b> that absence is regarded as a serious matter and may result in dismissal, it is <b>very important</b> that persistent absence is dealt with firmly and consistently. Records showing<b> lateness </b>and the duration of and explanations for all spells of absence should be kept to help monitor levels of absence or lateness. If the employer wishes to contact the employee’s doctor for more information about a medical condition, he or she must notify the employee in writing that they intend to make such an application and they must secure the employee’s<b> consent </b>in writing. Consideration should be given to introducing measures to help employees, regardless of status or seniority, who may be suffering from stress. The aim should be to identify employees affected and encourage them to seek help and treatment.","<b>A</b>","You don’t need a sat nav to drive to Oymyakon. From Yakutsk, you cross the Lena River and simply follow the M56 <b>almost all</b> of the way before taking a left at Tomtor for the final few kilometres. The journey takes <b>two days</b> of hard driving; <b>two days</b> of glistening landscapes, frozen rivers and<b> untouched </b>snow; <b>two days</b> of endless forest and breathtaking beauty; <b>two days</b> to<b> penetrate </b>the heart of Siberia and reach the coldest<b> inhabited </b>place on Earth. The beauty <b>surprised me</b>. Siberia isn’t known for its pleasant appearance. It’s always billed as a place of hardship. But for hour after hour, the<b> wintry </b>wonderland was bathed in a crisp, clean sunshine, presenting a continuous panorama of conifer trees wreathed in silence and snow.","<b>B</b>","As we left the flat plain, the road began to twist and turn, leading us into<b> untouched </b>hills and on towards the Verkhoyansk Mountains. Beneath their snow-clad peaks, the<b> slopes </b>became steeper and the valleys deeper. Down in a valley, we stopped to look at a hot spring beside the road. It was immediately obvious against the snow – a spot shrouded in heavy mist. Trees emerged from the strange haze as ghostly silhouettes.","<b>C</b>","Despite the magical<b> ambience </b>of the Siberian wilderness, its reputation for hardship hit me <b>every time</b> I climbed out of the vehicle. Within less than a minute, the skin all over my face began to feel as if it were burning. If I wasn’t wearing my two sets of gloves, I rapidly lost the feeling in my fingertips. I learned <b>very quickly</b> not to draw too deep a<b> breath </b>because the shock of the cold air in my lungs<b> invariably </b>set me off on an extended bout of coughing. Siberia in winter is a world barely fit for human habitation. This is a place of such searing cold that it bites through multiple layers of clothing as if they aren’t there.","<b>D</b>","Oymyakon is a quiet little town – the world’s coldest – of about 550 inhabitants, with its own power station, a school, two shops and a small hospital. It probably<b> originated </b>as a<b> seasonal </b>settlement where<b> reindeer </b>herders spent the summer on the banks of the Indigirka River.","<b>E</b>","The<b> temperature </b>when I arrived was -45°C – not particularly cold, I was informed. A number of factors combine to explain Oymyakon’s record low temperatures. It is far from the ocean, with its moderating effect on air temperature. In addition, the town sits in a valley, below the <b>general level</b> of the Oymyakon Plateau, which, in turn, is enclosed on all sides by mountains up to 2,000 metres in height. As the cold air sinks, it accumulates in the valley, with little wind to disturb it. Oymyakon’s average<b> temperature </b>in January is -50°C. Lower<b> temperatures </b>have been recorded in Antarctica, but there are no permanent<b> inhabitants </b>there.","<b>F</b>","Day-to-day life in Oymyakon presents certain challenges during the long winters. There are <b>hardly any</b> modern household conveniences. Water is hacked out of the nearby river as great chunks of ice and dragged home on a sledge. The giant ice cubes are stacked outdoors and carried into the house one at a time to melt when needed. The lack of running water also means no showers or baths, or indeed flushing toilets. Since 2008, the town’s <b>school has</b> enjoyed the luxury of indoor toilets, however. It’s one of the <b>small number</b> of civic buildings in the centre of town that are linked to the power station.","<b>G</b>","The power station provides winter heating in the form of hot water, but many houses lie outside its range and rely on their own wood-burning stove.<b> Fuel </b>is plentiful enough in the surrounding forest, but someone <b>still has</b> to venture out to cut the wood. Everybody in Oymyakon owns good boots, a hat made of animal fur and fur-lined mittens. The boots are usually made from<b> reindeer </b>hide, which is light but keeps your feet very warm – the individual hairs are hollow, like a thin tube with air inside. Since air is a poor conductor of heat, the skin makes<b> excellent </b>winter footwear, and felt soles give added insulation. Hats come in a variety of furs, including fox, raccoon, sable and mink.","<b>H</b>","Oymyakon’s two shops keep a decent stock of basic foods in tins and packets, but locals <b>also have</b> do-it-yourself options, including hunting, trapping, ice-fishing, reindeer-breeding and horse-breeding. Indeed, being self-sufficient runs in the blood in Siberia. The Oymyakon diet relies heavily on meat for its protein, a primary <b>source of energy</b> in the prolonged winter. Unsurprisingly, given the weather, everyone eats heartily in Oymyakon. A typical meal I was offered consisted of a thick horse soup and huge piles of horse meatballs, all washed down with cloudberry cordial.","<b>I</b>","Spring is the best season here, I’m told. The snow melts, the river flows once more and the forest is full of wildflowers. But it’s short. In the summer Oymyakon can be uncomfortably hot. Much of the forest becomes boggy, so<b> mosquitoes </b>are a constant presence. Oymyakon’s climate certainly wouldn’t suit me, but<b> residents </b>I spoke to said they wouldn’t live anywhere else."]},{"name":"GRE/13-2","paragraph":["<h2>Online roommate finder: Toronto</h2>","<b>I </b> <b>have one</b> <b>room available</b> in a large apartment located just off Queen and Bathurst in Toronto.

That includes specifying the date it is due, writing a clear definition of the task, <b>providing any</b> resources they <b>need to get</b> it done or names of people you expect them to talk to. It also means informing them of any expectations you have, such as delivering it as a spreadsheet rather than a Word document.","If you have concerns that someone doesn’t have the skills to do a good job (or they tell you this outright), <b>make sure</b> that you offer some help. It might take longer this time but <b>next time</b> they will be <b>able to do</b> it without you, so it will save you time in the <b>long run</b>.","<b>Once you have</b> given the task to someone, let them get on with it. Tell them how you expect to be kept informed, like through a report <b>once a week</b>. Then let them get on with it unless you feel things are not progressing as you would like.","As a project manager, you have to retain <b>some of the main</b> project<b> responsibilities </b>for yourself. You shouldn’t expect someone else on the project team to do your job. Equally, don’t delegate tasks such as dull administrative ones, <b>just because</b> you don’t <b>want to do</b> them. But remember that <b>project management</b> is a leadership position so you don’t want your role to be seen as too basic.","<b>One way</b> to free up your <b>time to spend</b> on the more strategic and leadership parts of <b>project management</b> is to delegate things that are regular, like noting whether weekly targets have been met. Could someone in your team take this on for you?

Don’t become the problem on your project that prevents progress <b>just because</b> you’re afraid to leave people alone to get on with their jobs.","Choosing the right format for your CV","<b>A </b> good CV should be clear, simple and easy to understand. Here are four of the <b>most popular</b> <b>CV format</b>s and advice on when to use them:","Chronological","This is the traditional <b>CV format</b> and is extremely popular because it allows employers to see all the posts you have held in order. It provides flexibility because it works in <b>almost all</b> circumstances, the exception being if you have blocks of unemployment that are difficult to account for. This type of format is <b>particularly useful</b> when you have a solid and complete working history spanning <b>five years</b> or more.","Functional","The <b>functional CV</b> is designed to describe your key skills rather than the jobs you <b>have done</b>. The <b>functional CV</b> format is typically used by <b>people who have</b> extensive gaps in their employment history, or have often changed jobs. It also suits those who <b>want to go</b> in a different direction work-wise and change industry. You might choose it if you want to highlight skills learned early in your career, points that might get missed if a<b> chronological </b>format is used. It is also appropriate if you <b>have done</b> <b>little or no</b> actual work, for example, if you are one of the current years graduates.","Because this format is often used to cover a<b> patchy </b>employment history, some interviewers may view such CVs with suspicion, so be <b>very careful</b> should you choose it.","Achievement","An alternative to the <b>functional CV</b> is to use an achievement-based resume highlighting key achievements in place of skills. This can help show your suitability for a role if you lack direct experience of it.","Non-traditional","With the<b> explosion </b>of digital and creative industries over <b>recent years</b>, <b>CV format</b>s <b>have become</b> more and more imaginative. You can present information through graphics, which can be more visually engaging and turn out to be an<b> unusual </b>but winning option. This will definitely make you stand out from the crowd. It also demonstrates design skills and creativity in a way that a potential employer can see and feel. However, a highly creative <b>CV format</b> is only really appropriate for creative and artistic sectors, such as those involving promoting products, though it would also work for the media too.","Dinosaur expert Dr Steve Brusatte continues to investigate the mysteries surrounding these fascinating<b> prehistoric </b>creatures","<b>I </b> was recently <b>part of a team</b> of<b> palaeontologists </b>that discovered a new dinosaur. Living in what is now China, the<b> species </b>would have<b> resembled </b>a strange bird. It was about the size of a sheep and covered in feathers, with a sharp beak that it probably used to<b> crack </b>open shellfish. It was given the formal scientific name Tongtianlong, but we called it ‘Mud Dragon’ because its skeleton was discovered in rock that had hardened from ancient mud. It seems that the creature got trapped in the mud and died. Then its<b> fossil </b>remains were found a <b>few months</b> ago when workmen were excavating a site in order to build a school.","It is every dinosaur-obsessed child’s dearest wish to discover and name a <b><b>completely new</b> species</b>. In fact what my colleagues and I did wasn’t that unusual. New<b> dinosaurs </b>are appearing everywhere these days – about 50 <b>each year</b>. And this pace <b>shows no</b> signs of slowing, as <b>different areas</b> continue to <b>open up</b> to<b> fossil </b>hunters and a fresh generation of scientists comes of age. Because of this plentiful supply of new fossils, we now know more about<b> dinosaurs </b>than we do about many modern animals. But there are still many unsolved mysteries.","Dinosaurs didn’t start out as huge monsters like Tyrannosaurus Rex. Instead they evolved from a group of angular, cat-sized<b> reptiles </b>called dinosauromorphs. These creatures remained small and rare for <b>millions of years</b> until they developed into dinosaurs. The boundary between<b> dinosauromorphs </b>and<b> dinosaurs </b>is becoming less and less distinct with each new discovery that’s made, but what’s becoming clear is that it took <b>millions of years</b> for these first<b> dinosaurs </b>to spread a<b>round the world</b>, grow to huge sizes and become truly dominant.","Some discoveries in the 1970s, like the agile and strangely bird-like Deinonychus, proved that<b> dinosaurs </b>were far more dynamic and intelligent than <b>previously thought</b>. Some<b> palaeontologists </b>even proposed that they were warm-blooded <b>creatures like</b> <b>modern birds</b> with a constant high body<b> temperature </b>that they controlled internally, rather than from warming themselves by <b>lying in the sun</b>. A <b>few decades</b> later opinions are still mixed. The problem is that<b> dinosaurs </b>can’t be observed.<b> Palaeontologists </b>must rely on studying fossils. Some results are convincing: we know from studying their bones that<b> dinosaurs </b>had <b>rapid growth</b> rates, <b>just like</b> modern, warm-blooded animals. Other palaeontologists, however, use the same<b> fossils </b>to suggest that<b> dinosaurs </b>were somewhere between cold-blooded<b> reptiles </b>and warm-blooded birds. More studies are needed to provide more clarity.","The discovery of Deinonychus with its long arms, skinny legs, arched neck and big claws on its feet, helped to<b> strengthen </b>the theory that birds evolved from dinosaurs. In the late 1990s, the discovery of thousands of feather-covered<b> dinosaurs </b>closed the argument. But the<b> fossils </b>raised another question: why did feathers first develop in dinosaurs? They probably<b> originated </b>as simple, hair-like<b> strands </b>— a necessary means of keeping warm. Many<b> dinosaurs </b>retained this basic fluffy coat, but in one group the<b> strands </b>modified. They grew bigger, started to branch out and changed into feathers like those on <b>modern birds</b>. They lined the arms, and sometimes the legs, forming wings. These feathers were probably for display: to attract<b> mates </b>or<b> scare </b>off rivals. They appeared in <b>species such</b> as the ostrich-like Ornithomimosaur. Such creatures were too large to fly. Flight may <b>actually have</b> come about by accident when smaller winged<b> dinosaurs </b>began jumping between trees or leaping in the air, and suddenly found that their wings had aerodynamic properties. This is <b>one of the most</b><b> stimulating </b>new notions about<b> dinosaurs </b>and a fascinating area for further investigation.","There’s something else that these feathers can tell us. They allow us to determine what colour<b> dinosaurs </b>were. If you look at modern bird feathers under a microscope, you can see tiny blobs called melanosomes. These structures contain melanin, <b>one of the main</b> colour-producing<b> pigments </b>in animals. Some are round, others are egg-shaped, etc. And that’s important, beca<b>use different</b> shapes contain different colour pigments. So if you can identify the shape, you can identify the colour. A <b><b>few years</b> ago</b>, some<b> palaeontologists </b>realised that you could find<b> melanosomes </b>in particularly well-preserved<b> fossil </b>feathers. They discovered that different<b> dinosaurs </b><b>had different</b> melanosomes, which meant they had a variety of colours. Dinosaurs, therefore, probably came in a rainbow of colours – yet <b>another thing</b> that links them to <b>modern birds</b>.","The most enduring<b> mystery </b>of all, which has been argued about <b>ever since</b> the first<b> dinosaur </b>fossils were found, is ‘Why aren’t<b> dinosaurs </b>around today?’ Of course, we now know that birds evolved from dinosaurs, so some<b> dinosaurs </b>do continue in a sense. But there’s nothing like a Tyrannosaurus Rex today. They<b> dominated </b>the planet for over 150 <b>million years</b>, but suddenly disappeared from the<b> fossil </b>record 66 <b>million years</b> ago. That’s when a 10 km-wide asteroid came out of space and struck what is now Mexico, impacting with huge force and unleashing earthquakes,<b> tidal </b>waves, wildfires and hurricane-force winds. Although<b> palaeontologists </b>still like to argue about what part the asteroid played in the dinosaurs’ extinction, there really isn’t much of a<b> mystery </b>left. The asteroid did it and did it quickly. There are few signs that<b> dinosaurs </b>were struggling before the impact. None survived except a few birds and some small<b> furry </b>mammals. They <b>found themselves</b> in an empty world, and as the planet started to recover, they evolved into new creatures, including the first apes, and so the long journey began to the beginning of humankind."]},{"name":"GRE/13-3","paragraph":["NYLSO, the <b>New York</b> Late-Starters String Orchestra, is <b>something special</b>.

And, yet, the<b> vanilla </b>orchid is only grown in a few countries. Below you’ll discover why these countries are ideal and how the<b> vanilla </b>from each region differs.","Mexico","Vanilla (Vanilla planifolia Andrews)<b> originated </b>in Mexico and for centuries was the<b> exclusive </b>secret of the native Totonac Indians, who were later<b> conquered </b>by the Aztecs. The Aztecs, in turn, were<b> conquered </b>by the Spanish forces led by Cortez in 1520. He brought <b>vanilla pods</b> home to Spain, thus introducing the flavorful<b> pods </b>to the <b>rest of the world</b>.","However, Mexico remained the sole grower of<b> vanilla </b>for another 300 years. The particular relationship between the<b> vanilla </b>orchid and an<b> indigenous </b>bee called the Melipone was crucial. It was<b> responsible </b>for pollinating the flowers, resulting in fruit production.","<b>Vanilla pods</b> should be picked when the tip begins to turn yellow. The <b>curing process</b> gives the<b> pods </b>their characteristic brown color as well as their flavor and aroma. In Mexico, farmers cure the<b> pods </b>by wrapping them in blankets and<b> straw </b>mats and then placing them in ovens for 24 to 48 hours. After that, the<b> pods </b>are spread outdoors to absorb heat <b>during the day</b> and then placed in wooden boxes overnight. Once properly cured, they are stored to further develop the flavor. The entire <b>curing process</b> takes three to <b>six months</b>, making it a very labor-intensive process.","Vanilla from Mexico has a flavor that combines creamy tones with a deep, spicy character, making it a delicious complement to chocolate,<b> cinnamon </b>and other warm spices. It also works wonderfully in tomato sauces.","Madagascar","Around 1793, a<b> vanilla </b>plant was<b> smuggled </b>from Mexico to the Island of Reunion, east of Africa. For almost 50 years, the production of<b> vanilla </b>struggled. The<b> vines </b>grew successfully with beautiful blossoms but <b>vanilla pods</b> were infrequent. Without the Melipone bee, the flowers weren’t being<b> fertilized </b>beyond occasional<b> pollination </b>by other insects. It wasn’t until 1836 that Charles Morren, a Belgian botanist, discovered the<b> pollination </b>link between bee and plant. And then in 1841, Edmond Albius of Reunion developed an <b>efficient method</b> for fertilizing the flower by hand. Now, growers could choose the best flowers to pollinate, resulting in a healthier and <b>higher quality</b><b> vanilla </b>pod.","Eventually, the plants arrived on the nearby island of Madagascar, where hand<b> pollination </b>proved its worth. Assisted by the climate and rich soil, hand<b> pollination </b>by the country’s skilled farmers has enabled Madagascar to become the world’s top<b> vanilla </b>producer in quantity and, many would argue, quality.","The <b>curing process</b> is similar to that in Mexico with one difference. The farmers initiate the process by immersing the green <b>vanilla pods</b> in hot water for <b>some time</b>. They then store them in sweat boxes before beginning the routine of spreading them outdoors <b>during the day</b> and packing them away at night. The different curing method used contributes to the overall flavor of the vanilla.","The sweet, creamy and mellow flavor is the one <b>most people</b> identify with vanilla. This flavor and the pod’s ability to hold that flavor in both hot and cold applications make it an exceptional ‘all-purpose’<b> vanilla </b>which is <b>many people</b>’s <b>first choice</b> for a <b>wide range</b> of sweet recipes – from cooking and baking to ice creams and buttercreams.","Tahiti","Like the <b>other countries</b>, Tahiti’s tropical climate makes it ideal for growing vanilla. However, Tahiti differs in the<b> species </b>of<b> vanilla </b>that is most common:<b> Vanilla </b>tahitensis Moore. This is the hybrid of two vanilla<b> species </b>introduced in the 1800s. These two<b> species </b>were skilfully crossed in the next <b>few decades</b>, to create the plump Tahitian <b>vanilla pods</b> we know today.","The <b>curing process</b> also differs from <b>other countries</b>’. Mature<b> pods </b>are first stacked in a cool place until they are completely brown (five to <b>ten days</b>) and then<b> rinsed </b>briefly in clear water, a unique characteristic of the method used in Tahiti. For the <b>next month</b>, growers expose the<b> pods </b>to the<b> gentle </b>morning sunlight. In the afternoon, they bind the<b> pods </b>in cloths and store them in crates until the next morning, to promote transpiration. Little by little, the <b>vanilla pods</b> <b>lose weight</b> and shrink. Throughout this phase, the workers carefully smooth and even out the<b> pods </b>with their fingers. Then after a month, the final step is to leave the<b> pods </b>in a shaded and well-ventilated spot for 40 days to lower their<b> moisture </b>content.","This<b> species </b>of<b> orchid </b>combined with Tahiti’s advantageous climate and soil results in a<b> vanilla </b>that has fruity and sweet tones. Tahitian<b> vanilla </b>is especially<b> vulnerable </b>to heat and is therefore best used in<b> refrigerated </b>and frozen desserts, fruit pies and smoothies.","Indonesia","Indonesia is the second largest producer of vanilla. However, Indonesian production methods focus on quantity over quality. Un<b>like other</b> regions, where<b> vanilla </b>beans are picked only when ripe, Indonesian growers harvest all the beans at <b>one time</b>, a labor-saving adjustment.","The <b>curing process</b> also features production shortcuts such as the use of propane heaters to speed up drying. The use of such heat, which chemically alters the beans, essentially ‘bums off flavor components while adding a smoky tone, resulting in a less complex taste and a sharper flavor. Indonesian<b> vanilla </b><b>works well</b> when blended with vanillas from other regions and, because it’s more economical, it makes the end product more affordable."]},{"name":"GRE/13-4","paragraph":["The<b> Guardian </b>Newspaper’s Travel<b> Photography </b>Competition","The photo competition is back, giving you another chance to win an incredible trip to Swedish Lapland.","<b>Do you have</b> a camera and love travelling?

Before sending <b>cleaning staff</b> to the offices, the manager of the <b>cleaning service</b> carried out a <b>risk assessment</b> using guidance provided by the <b><b>Health and Safety</b> Executive</b> (HSE).","To identify the hazards, the <b>cleaning service</b> manager visited the office complex and walked through the areas where <b>cleaning staff</b> would be working, noting things that might pose potential risks. Following this, he<b> consulted </b>the <b>health and safety</b><b> representatives </b>of the <b>cleaning service</b> about these risks, taking into account the needs of <b>any particular</b> staff members, such as whether they were pregnant or aged under 18.","In order to gather further information, he then had a meeting with the client company during which a number of issues were discussed. These included the client company’s own standard of housekeeping, such as the immediate clearing up of spills and keeping walkways clear, as well as the action to be taken if a fire broke out. He also established what<b> facilities </b>and equipment would be available to the cleaners, including the amount of storage space available, as well as the availability of<b> sinks </b>and taps, etc. and agreed on a method of reporting near-miss accidents and risks discovered by cleaners (e.g. damaged floor tiles).","Following the meeting, the manager created a <b>risk assessment</b> document. He wrote down who could be harmed by each risk or<b> hazard </b>identified and in what way, and he then described what controls, if any, were in existence to manage these hazards. The manager then compared these to the good practice guidance set out on the HSE’s website and identified <b>any areas</b> where improvement was needed.","The manager discussed the findings with the <b>cleaning staff</b>, <b>making sure</b> they understood the risks of the job and how these risks would be monitored. One cleaner, whose first language was not English, had <b>difficulty understanding</b> this, so the manager arranged for translation to be done by a bilingual cleaner from <b>another team</b>. Finally, to ensure that <b>all the cleaning</b> staff <b>had access</b> to a copy of the <b>risk assessment</b>, the manager pinned a copy in the cupboard where cleaning equipment was kept.","Preparing for a virtual job interview","Businesses are always looking for <b>new ways</b> to increase efficiency and profits. For example, organisations often reduce costs by conducting virtual job interviews. The video or Skype interview benefits both interviewer and interviewee, especially when an applicant would otherwise need to travel far. Despite the convenience though, it poses unique challenges.","How a <b>virtual interview</b> is the same","The typical interview process usually<b> entails </b>multiple steps. First, there is screening, lasting about thirty minutes. Its purpose is to ensure candidates have the basic requirements. In the second interview, they’re assessed for their technical skills and on whether they would fit the organisation.","<b>Virtual interview</b>s follow the same steps so you’ll <b>need to focus</b> on the same core topics. Identify what the critical topics are based on the job description and prepare to talk about them. If you can, gather inside information so you can impress interviewers with your knowledge.","How a <b>virtual interview</b> is different","Normally you travel somewhere for an interview. One advantage of that is that you aren’t<b> responsible </b>for the place, whereas in a <b>virtual interview</b> you must ensure you have an appropriate location and appropriate equipment.","<b>Modern technology</b> is great when it works, but a pain when it doesn’t. So, it’s wise to check you can operate your webcam, especially if you don’t use it often. Test the headset too and find out how intelligible your voice sounds. It’s also wise to establish what software the interviewer is going to work with and give it a trial run.","Probably the biggest problem in a <b>virtual interview</b> is what the camera can see. You want the interviewer to see you as a professional. Having a messy or cluttered room behind you won’t <b>help you achieve</b> this image – a clear white background is usually a safe bet.","The <b>most <b>important part</b></b> of your preparation is to run through everything first as best you can. Have a friend conduct a<b> rehearsal </b>with you before the big day. This will help you know how to behave in front of the camera.","All things considered, though, <b>virtual interview</b>s should be treated like <b>any other</b> type of interview. Being at home requires as much preparation as a traditional interview. If you follow the steps mentioned above, you <b>have ever</b>y chance of getting the job you want. <b>Good luck</b>!","Tuning up your leadership skills","Does jazz music offer lessons for today’s leaders?","<b>A</b>","<b>Ever since</b> management expert Peter Drucker compared the job of <b>Chief Executive</b> Officer to that of an<b> orchestra </b>conductor, the business <b>world has</b> been<b> exploring </b>comparisons and inspirations from the world of music. Now Warwick <b>Business School</b> Professors Deniz Ucbasaran and Andy Lockett are hitting all the right notes with their study of famous jazz musicians, Leading<b> Entrepreneurial </b>Teams: Insights From Jazz, providing some essential insights for<b> entrepreneurial </b><b>team leader</b>s.","<b>Ucbasaran and Lockett</b> (together with Durham <b>Business School</b> Professor Michael Humphries) chose jazz for a number of reasons. For a start, <b>jazz band</b>s are synonymous with creativity,<b> improvisation </b>and innovation, all essential ingredients for entrepreneurship. Jazz groups and their <b>members often</b> operate in uncertain and dynamic environments, characterised by rapid change. Yet through collective<b> endeavour </b>many <b>jazz band</b>s find their own structure and harmony and become profitable<b> enterprises </b>– both creatively and commercially.","<b>B</b>","The authors decided to focus on three of the <b>best known</b> names in jazz – Duke Ellington, <b>Miles Davis</b> and Art Blakey. American<b> composer </b>Duke Ellington was a pioneering jazz<b> orchestra </b>leader from the 1920s through to the 1970s.<b> Trumpet </b>player <b>Miles Davis</b> was instrumental in the development of a number of new jazz styles, including bebop and jazz fusion. Jazz drummer Arthur ‘Art’ Blakey became famous as the leader of his band the Jazz Messengers.","The research focused on the way that these jazz greats created and ran their musical enterprises. In particular, <b>Ucbasaran and Lockett</b> focused on three specific areas of leadership activity: team formation, team coordination and team turnover.","There were strong<b> similarities </b>in the processes the band leaders used to assemble their diverse teams of talent. In particular, they looked for<b> musicians </b>with a different sound or way of playing, one that was unique to that band member and would improve the overall sound of the band. That feature was as much bound up with the personality of the individual<b> musician </b>as it was to do with their technical proficiency.","<b>C</b>","But disparate teams, <b>many different</b> personalities, and <b><b>high level</b>s</b> of creativity are a recipe for group conflict. And, sure enough, there was plenty of dysfunctional conflict and<b> disruptive </b>clashes of egos and<b> personalities </b>evident in the jazz ensembles.","Traditional <b>team leader</b>ship <b>theory suggests</b> that to <b>get the best</b> team performance the leader should<b> foster </b>conflict that is productive in its effects, while<b> minimising </b><b>destructive conflict</b>. But this is difficult when the sources of productive and <b>destructive conflict</b> are the same; that is, differences in personality and thinking. So how do leaders deal with <b>destructive conflict</b>? It didn’t seem to bother the likes of Ellington, <b>Davis and Blakey</b>.","Their attitude was ‘the music comes first’. The moments of musical genius when everything came together excused minor problems such as if individuals occasionally turned up late for practice, or stepped out of a performance for a quick snack.","<b>D</b>","Teams must coordinate their behaviour and action to achieve an outcome. The <b>team leader</b> can assume a <b>number of different</b> roles when helping the team achieve its objectives. Some leaders are very directive, detailing what tasks they want <b>team members</b> to perform, and how they want them to go about those tasks.","But that was not the approach Ellington, <b>Davis and Blakey</b> adopted. Instead, these leaders acted more as facilitators, empowering the<b> musicians </b>to collectively coordinate their behaviour and action to produce the desired outcome. As <b>Ucbasaran and Lockett</b> note, <b>Miles Davis</b> discouraged band members from rehearsing in case it led to musical cliches from over-practice. Similarly, he often asked his<b> musicians </b>to play a piece in an<b> unusual </b>key, so they did not rely on learned fingering patterns. The performers were not left entirely to their own devices though. All <b>three leaders</b> created a general framework within which <b>team members</b> could work, providing guidance but also the freedom to explore, express and make mistakes.","<b>E</b>","The third aspect of leadership behaviour that Ucbasaran and her <b>colleagues looked</b> at was managing team turnover – people joining and leaving the team. In the jazz<b> ensembles </b>studied,<b> musicians </b>joined and left on a <b>regular basis</b>. Yet the high turnover of <b>team members</b>, despite the resulting loss of knowledge and skills, was seen in a positive light. That was <b>partly because</b> of the advantages of getting a fresh shot of knowledge, ideas and creativity when new members joined.","<b>A </b> common reason for the jazz<b> musicians </b>leaving was that they felt sufficiently qualified to go and run another band. The three band leaders were understanding about this, particularly as it was a process they had also been through. In <b>some cases</b>, in particular with Art Blakey, they actively encouraged and coached <b>team members</b> to become leaders. As the jazz icons Ellington, <b>Davis and Blakey</b> would <b>no doubt</b> agree, there is  no magic score that if followed note by note will make you a great leader of creative talent. However, take an entrepreneur, a few<b> cues </b>from the aforementioned jazz trio, mix in a little improvisation, and you are more likely to hear the sweet sound of success.

Bureaucracies <b>have become</b> the backbone of civilizations, as governments try to <b>keep track</b> of populations, business transactions and taxes. At a personal level, our lives are governed by the documents we possess; we are certified on paper literally from birth to death. And written documentation carries enormous cultural importance: consider the consequences of signing the Foundation Document of the <b>United Nations</b> or the Convention on Biological Diversity.","Documentation requires a writing tool and a surface upon which to record the information permanently. About 5,000 <b>years ago</b>, the Sumerians started to use<b> reeds </b>or sticks to make marks on mud blocks which were then baked, but despite being fireproof, these were difficult to store. Other cultures used more flexible but less permanent surfaces, including animal skins and wood strips. In western culture, the adoption of<b> papyrus </b>was to <b>have a great</b> impact. <b>Sheets of papyrus</b> not only provide an<b> invaluable </b>record of people’s daily lives, they can also be dated using carbon-dating techniques, giving precise information about the age of the text written on them.","<b>B</b>","Papyrus is strongly associated with Egyptian culture, <b>although all</b> the ancient civilizations around the Mediterranean used it. The <b>papyrus sedge</b> is a tall grass-like plant. It was harvested from shallow water and swamplands on the banks of the River Nile. Manufacturing <b>sheets of papyrus</b> from <b>papyrus sedge</b> was a complex, messy process. Pith from inside the plant’s<b> stem </b>was cut into long<b> strips </b>that were<b> laid </b>side by side. These were then covered with a second layer of<b> strips </b>which were<b> laid </b>at right angles to the first, then<b> soaked </b>in water and hammered together. The sheet was then crushed to extract the water,<b> dried </b>and then<b> polished </b>to produce a high-quality writing surface, individual sheets could be glued together and rolled up to make scrolls or folded and bound to form books.","<b>C</b>","In<b> moist </b>climates, the cellulose-rich <b>sheets of papyrus</b> would readily decay, becoming covered by<b> mould </b>or full of holes from attacks by insects. But in dry climates, such as the <b>Middle East</b>,<b> papyrus </b>is a stable, rot-resistant writing surface. The earliest known roll of<b> papyrus </b>scroll was found in the tomb of an official called Hemeka near Memphis, which was then the capital city of Egypt, and is around five <b>thousand years</b> old. in 79CE, nearly 2,000<b> papyrus </b>scrolls in the library of Julius Caesar’s father-in-law were protected at Herculaneum by ash from the catastrophic<b> eruption </b>of Mount Vesuvius. However, the <b>most famous</b> discoveries of<b> papyrus </b><b>have come</b> from the rubbish<b> dumps </b>of the ancient town of Oxyrhynchus, some 160km south-west of Cairo, in the<b> desert </b>to the west of the Nile. Oxyrhynchus was a regional administrative capital and for a <b>thousand years</b> generated vast amounts of administrative documentation, including accounts, <b>tax returns</b> and correspondence, which was<b> periodically </b>discarded to make room for more. Over time, a thick layer of sand covered these dumps, andthey were forgotten. But the documents were protected by the sand, creating a time capsule that allowed astonishing glimpses into the lives of the town’s<b> inhabitants </b>over <b>hundreds of years</b>.","Collections of documents that <b>record information</b> and ideas have frequently been viewed as <b>potentially dangerous</b>. For <b>thousands of years</b>, governments, despots and conquerors have resorted to burning libraries and books to<b> rid </b>themselves of inconvenient evidence or obliterate cultures and ideas that they found politically, morally or religiously unacceptable. <b>One such</b> calamity, the burning of the Great Library of Alexandria, and the<b> papyrus </b>scrolls and books it contained, has been mythologized and <b>has come</b> to symbolize the global loss of cultural knowledge.","<b>D</b>","Besides their use in record-keeping,<b> papyrus </b>stems were used in <b>m<b>any other</b></b> aspects of Mediterranean life, such as for boat construction and making ropes, sails and baskets, as well as being a source of food. In 1969 the adventurer <b>Thor Heyerdahl</b> attempted to cross the Atlantic from Morocco in the boat Ra, to show that it was possible for<b> mariners </b>in <b>ancient times</b> to cross the Atlantic Ocean. Ra was made from bundles of<b> papyrus </b>stems and modelled on <b>ancient Egypt</b>ian craft. As a marshland plant, <b>papyrus sedge</b> stabilizes soils and reduces erosion, <b>while some</b> investigations show that it has potential for water purification and<b> sewage </b>treatment.","<b>E</b>","True paper was probably invented in China in the <b><b>first century</b> CE</b>. Like papyrus, it was constructed from a meshwork of plant fibres, but the Chinese used<b> fibres </b>from the white<b> mulberry </b>tree, which yielded a tough, flexible material that could be folded, stretched, and compressed. The adoption of this paper by <b>western cultures</b> soon rendered<b> papyrus </b>obsolete.","Despite dreams of paper-free societies, <b>western cultures</b> still use enormous quantities of paper, often in ways that it would be inconceiv<b>able to use</b><b> papyrus </b>for. As a paper substitute, the role of the <b>papyrus sedge</b> in <b>western cultures</b> has been superseded;<b> papyrus </b>is little more than a<b> niche </b>product for the tourist market. What makes papyrus<b> noteworthy </b>for western<b> societies </b>nowadays is its use as the surface upon which our ancient ancestors recorded their lives, their art and their science. In the words of the <b>ancient Roman</b><b> philosopher </b>Pliny the Elder, it is ‘the material on which the immortality of <b>human beings</b> depends’.","—————————","*From Stephen Harris, What have Plants Ever Done for Us?, Bodleian Library Publishing 2015.

When we arrive and check in, we’re always treated like old friends by the staff, so we <b>very much</b> feel at home. Our one disappointment during our last visit was that our room<b> overlooked </b>the <b>car park</b>, but that didn’t<b> spoil </b>our stay.","<b>B</b>","The hotel hardly <b>seems to have</b> changed in the last <b>hundred years</b>, and we prefer that to many modern hotels, which tend to look the same as <b>each other</b>. The Wellington has character! Our room was very comfortable and quite spacious. We can strongly recommend the breakfast, though we had to wait for a table as the hotel was so full. That was a bit annoying, and there was also nowhere to sit in the lounge.","<b>C</b>","We made our<b> reservation </b>by phone without problem, but when we arrived the<b> receptionist </b>couldn’t see it on the computer system. Luckily there was a <b>room available</b>. It wasn’t quite what we would have chosen, but it was a pleasure to sit in it with a cup of tea, and look out at the swimmers and surfers in the sea.","<b>D</b>","We’d be happy to stay at the Wellington again. Although there’s nothing special about the rooms, the view from the<b> lounge </b>is lovely, and the restaurant staff were friendly and efficient. Breakfast was a highlight – there was so much on offer we could hardly decide what to eat. We’d stay <b>another time</b> just for that!","<b>E</b>","The staff all did their jobs efficiently, and were <b>very helpful</b> when we asked for information about the area. The only difficulty we had was making our<b> reservation </b>online – it wasn’t clear whether payment for our deposit went through or not, and I had to call the hotel to find out. Still, once we’d arrived, everything went very smoothly, and we had a delicious dinner in the restaurant.","Come and play <b>walking football</b> or walking netball","<b>Walking football</b> and<b> netball </b><b>have become</b> increasingly <b>popular in recent</b> years, but <b>do you know</b> you can <b>take part</b> in this area? The names make it clear what they are – two of the country’s favourite sports where, instead of running, the players walk. It’s as simple as that.","<b>Walking football</b> was invented in the UK in 2011, but it was a 2014 TV commercial for a bank, showing it providing financial support to someone who wanted to <b>set up</b> a website for the game, that brought it to people’s attention. Since then, tens of <b>thousands of people</b> — mostly, though not only, over the age of 50 — have started playing, and there are more than 800 <b>walking football</b> clubs. Both <b>men and women</b> play <b>walking football</b>, but at the moment the<b> netball </b>teams consist only of women. However, men are <b>beginning to show</b> an interest in playing.","The two games are designed to <b>help people</b> to be active or get fit, whatever their age and level of fitness. In particular, they were invented to encourage older <b>men and women</b> to get more exercise, and to give them a chance to meet <b>other people</b>. Regular <b>physical activity</b> helps to maintain energy, strength and flexibility. You can start gently and <b>do a little</b> more each session. The benefits include lower heart rate and blood pressure, greater mobility, less fat and more muscle.","Many players <b>have given</b> up a sport – either through age or injury – and can now <b>take it up</b> again. They’re great ways for people to enjoy a sport they used to play and love, and keep active at the <b>same time</b>, though <b>people who have</b> never played the standard game before are also <b>very welcome</b>.","The <b>local council</b>s Active Lifestyles Team runs sessions at all the council’s leisure centres. Come alone or with a friend, and enjoy a friendly game on Monday or Saturday afternoons, or <b>Tuesday or Thursday</b> evenings. Each session costs £3 <b>per person</b>, and you don’t <b>have to come</b> regularly or at the <b>same time</b> <b>each week</b>. Our aim is to <b>set up</b><b> netball </b>and football clubs as soon as there are enough regular players.","Questions 8-14","Dress regulations at work","Your contract may state that you need to dress in a certain manner or wear a uniform. Your contract might also state that you need to dress ‘smartly’, rather than specifying <b>any particular</b> garments. As you might well have conflicting ideas of what counts as smart’, you should <b>ask your employer</b> for clarification. <b>Many employers</b> that have a strict <b>dress code</b> choose to provide clothing or a discount on clothing. However, this is not necessarily compulsory for the employer and is a factor you <b>need to consider</b> when taking a job.","Protective <b>clothing and equipment</b>","Your employer can tell you to put on protective <b>clothing and equipment</b> (such as gloves, a visor, boots, etc.). If you don’t, your employer is<b> entitled </b>to take disciplinary action, which can include excluding you from the workplace.","You are required to:","•  co-operate with your employer on <b>health and safety</b>","•  correctly use work items provided by your employer, including protective equipment, in accordance with instructions","•  not interfere with or mis<b>use any</b>thing provided for your <b>health and safety</b> or welfare.","Of course, any protective gear has to fit and be appropriate for the situation. It shouldn’t cause you pain. If it does, you should negotiate alternative equipment or arrangements. Don’t be put off. Sometimes employers can, out of caution,<b> interpret </b><b>health and safety</b> rules unnecessarily rigidly. And of course, you shouldn’t be required to pay for any protective equipment or clothing that you need. However, if your employer buys the gear, they are<b> entitled </b>to keep it when you leave.","The obligation to maintain <b>protective clothing</b> lies with the employer. The employer is <b>also required</b> to provide an appropriate storage space to keep the protective equipment in when it is not being used. And finally, the employer must provide the equipment and service <b>free of charge</b> to the employee.","Jewellery","Banning employees from wearing<b> jewellery </b>and loose clothing may be justified to prevent a potential<b> hygiene </b>hazard if you work in areas of <b>food production</b> or areas which need to be kept sterile.","Likewise, your employer can judge that loose<b> jewellery </b>may constitute a snagging<b> hazard </b>if you operate machinery. If you think restrictions are not justified by <b>health and safety</b> concerns, talk to your workplace union rep if you <b>have one</b>, as they may know of solutions to the problem which <b>other employees</b> <b>have used</b> before.","How to achieve a better work-life balance","As more and more employees <b>work from home</b> full time and <b>every<b>one has</b></b> 24/7 access to email, <b>balancing <b>work and family</b></b> may not seem like an easily attainable goal. So how can you<b> juggle </b>the demands of both worlds? Below are <b>some tips</b> to <b>help you get</b> started.","It’s <b>easy to get</b> sucked into habits that, make us less efficient without realizing it – like keeping your <b>social media</b> page open at work so you don’t miss something ‘important’. <b>Draw up</b> a list with all the activities that don’t enhance your life or career. Then minimize the time you spend on them.","It’s hard to say no’, especially to a<b> supervisor </b>or loved one, but sometimes that powerful little word is essential. Learn to use ‘no’ judiciously and it will become a powerful tool in <b>balancing <b>work and family</b></b>.","<b>Research shows</b> that exercise helps you remain alert. Finding time to hit the gym may be hard, but it will ultimately <b>help you get</b> more <b>things do</b>ne because exercise really boosts energy and improves your ability to concentrate.","Study after study shows that significant sleep deprivation affects your health and well-being.<b> Exposure </b>to electronics can significantly negatively impact your sleep, so try to unplug an hour before you go to sleep.","What would you do if you had a whole day to yourself with no demands on your time? While <b>most people</b> don’t have the luxury of a whole day dedicated to relaxation, constantly putting off that downtime and putting everyone’s needs before yours will wear you down. Pick a time to <b><b>do some</b>thing</b> just for you. Even just a <b>few minutes</b> of ‘me time’ a day will help to recharge your batteries.","Don’t assume your family and manager are aware of your concerns. If you feel you have to adjust your schedule to discover a better work-life balance, then voice that requirement. If that means asking your boss for permission to leave a <b>few minutes</b> early <b>once a week</b> so you can hit that yoga class on the way home, do it.","<b>All new</b> habits require time to build, so if you <b>find yourself</b> sneaking your smartphone to bed, that’s okay. Leave your phone downstairs tomorrow night. Tiny steps are the key to finding that balance, so start small, and go from there. Most of all, know your limitations and what works best for you; then decide what <b>really matters</b>, what advice you want to follow, and prioritize.","<b>San Francisco</b>’s <b>Golden <b>Gate Bridge</b></b>","<b>A</b>","For several decades in the <b>nineteenth century</b>, there were calls to connect the rapidly growing<b> metropolis </b>of <b>San Francisco</b> to its neighbours across the mile-wide <b>Golden Gate</b> Strait, where <b>San Francisco</b> Bay opens onto the <b>Pacific Ocean</b>. Eventually, in 1919, officials asked the city engineer, Michael O’Shaughnessy, to explore the possibility of building a bridge. He began to consult engineers across the USA about the feasibility of doing so, and the cost. Most doubted whether a bridge could be built at all, or<b> estimated </b>that it would cost $100 million. However, a Chicago-based engineer named Joseph Strauss believed he could complete the project for a modest $25 to $30 million. After his proposal was accepted, Strauss set about convincing the communities on the northern end of the strait that the bridge would be to their benefit, as well as to that of <b>San Francisco</b>. With population centres growing fast, there was severe <b>traffic congestion</b> at the<b> ferry </b>docks, and motor<b> vehicle </b><b>travel by ferry</b> was fast exceeding capacity.","<b>B</b>","The bridge could not be constructed without the agreement of the US War Department, which owned the land on each side of the Strait and had the power to prevent any harbour construction that might affect shipping traffic. In 1924, <b>San Francisco</b> and Marin counties applied for a permit to build a bridge, and after hearing<b> overwhelming </b>arguments in favour of the project, the<b> Secretary </b>of War agreed. Despite the economic benefits promised by its supporters, the project met fierce<b> resistance </b>from a number of businesses – particularly<b> ferry </b>companies – and civic leaders. Not only would the bridge be an obstacle to shipping and<b> spoil </b>the bay’s natural beauty, they argued, it wouldn’t survive the sort of earthquake that had devastated the city in 1906. Eight years of legal actions followed as opponents tried to prevent it from being built.","<b>C</b>","Meanwhile, Strauss’s team<b> scrapped </b>their original plans in favour of a<b> suspension </b>span capable of moving more than two feet to each side: this would<b> withstand </b>strong wind <b>far better</b> than a<b> rigid </b>structure. They also planned the two towers, and decided on a paint colour they called ‘international orange’.","<b>D</b>","O’Shaughnessy, Strauss and the<b> Secretary </b>to the Mayor of <b>San Francisco</b> believed a special district needed to be created, with<b> responsibility </b>for planning, designing and financing construction. The formation of this district would enable all the counties affected by the bridge to have a say in the proceedings. This happened in 1928, when the California legislature passed an act to establish the <b>Golden <b>Gate Bridge</b></b> and Highway District, consisting of six counties. In 1930,<b> residents </b>voted on the question of whether to <b>put up</b> their homes, their farms and their business properties as security for a $35 million bond issue to finance construction. The outcome was a large majority in favour.","However, the District struggled to find a financial backer amid the difficulties of the Great Depression, a problem <b>made worse</b> by years of expensive legal proceedings. Now desperate, Strauss personally<b> sought </b>help from the President of Bank of America, who provided a crucial boost by agreeing to buy $6 million in bonds in 1932.","<b>E</b>","Construction began in January 1933, with the<b> excavation </b>of a vast amount of rock to establish the bridge’s two anchorages – the structures in the ground that would take the tension from the<b> suspension </b>cables. The crew consisted of virtually anyone capable of withstanding the physical<b> rigours </b>of the job, as out-of-work<b> cab </b>drivers, farmers and clerks lined up for the <b>chance to earn</b> steady wages as ironworkers and<b> cement </b>mixers.","The attempt to build what would be the first bridge support in the open ocean proved an<b> immense </b>challenge. Working from a long framework built out from the <b>San Francisco</b> side, divers plunged to depths of 90 feet through strong currents to blast away rock and remove the debris. The framework was damaged when it was struck by a<b> ship </b>in August 1933 and again during a powerful storm later in the year, setting construction back <b>five months</b>.","<b>F</b>","The two towers were completed in June 1935, and a New Jersey-based company was appointed to handle the on-site construction of the<b> suspension </b>cables. Its engineers had mastered a technique in which individual<b> steel </b>wires were banded together in spools and carried across the length of the bridge on<b> spinning </b>wheels. Given a year to complete the task, they instead finished in just over <b>six months</b>, having spun more than 25,000 individual wires into each massive cable.","The roadway was completed in April 1937, and the bridge <b>officially opened</b> to<b> pedestrians </b>the following month. The next day, President Roosevelt announced its opening via White House telegraph.","<b>G</b>","The <b>Golden Gate</b> has endured as a marvel of modern engineering; its main span was the longest in the world for a <b>suspension bridge</b> until 1981, while its towers made it the tallest bridge of any type until 1993. It<b> withstood </b>a destructive earthquake in 1989 and was <b>closed to traffic</b> only <b>three times</b> in its first 75 years due to <b>weather conditions</b>. Believed to be the most, photographed bridge in the world, this landmark was named one of the seven civil engineering wonders of the <b>United States</b> by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 1994."]},{"name":"GRE/14-3","paragraph":["<h2>Your guide to entertainment in Westhaven</h2>","<b>A </b>     TRAX INDOOR KARTING CENTRE","Experience the fun and thrills of indoor racing driving in our mini open-topped karts. <b>No experience</b> necessary.

For example, your activities may be recorded on CCTV cameras, and your letters may be opened and read. In addition, your employer may use an automated software programme to check the emails you receive at work. <b>Phone calls</b> may be listened to and recorded, and the log of websites you use may be checked.","All of these forms of monitoring are covered by data protection law. Data protection law doesn’t prevent monitoring in the workplace. However, it does set down rules about the circumstances and the way in which monitoring should be carried out.","Before deciding whether to introduce monitoring, your employer should <b>identify any</b> negative effects the monitoring may have on staff. This is called impact assessment.","Monitoring<b> electronic </b>communications at work","Your employer can legally monitor your use of<b> electronic </b>communications in the workplace if the monitoring relates to the business and the equipment being monitored is provided partly or wholly for work.","Except in extremely limited circumstances, employers must <b>take reasonable</b> steps to let staff know that monitoring is happening, what is being monitored and why it is necessary.","As long as your employer sticks to these rules, they don’t <b>need to get</b> your<b> consent </b>before they monitor your<b> electronic </b>communications, but only if the monitoring is for specific reasons. These may be to establish facts which are<b> relevant </b>to the business or to check standards, for example, listening in to <b>phone calls</b> to assess the quality of your work. Monitoring is also allowed if its purpose is to prevent or detect crime. It may be necessary to <b>make sure</b><b> electronic </b>systems are operating effectively, for example, to prevent computer viruses entering the system. Your employer is also allowed to listen in to any calls you make to confidential helplines, but in this case he or she is not allowed to record these calls.","If you want to travel and work<b> temporarily </b>in Canada as part of International Experience Canada (IEC), your <b>first step</b> is to become a candidate in one or more <b>IEC pools</b>.

And more people means a requirement for more food.","Ethiopia, for example, has the largest<b> livestock </b>population in Africa but with a growing population, even its 53 million cattle are not enough. And now efforts to develop fanning there are bringing a significant health concern. Professor James Wood from the <b>University of Cambridge</b> explains that new breeds that are being introduced are more<b> vulnerable </b>to bovine TB (tuberculosis) than the zebu cattle which were previously reared there. ‘This may have health implications for those who work with and live alongside infected cattle, and also raises concerns about transmission to areas which <b>previously had</b> <b>low levels</b> of TB,’ he warns.","Wood leads a research programme which is looking at the feasibility of control strategies, including cattle vaccination. The programme <b>brings together</b> veterinary scientists, epidemiologists, geneticists, immunologists and<b> social </b>scientists in eight Ethiopian and UK institutions. ‘We need this mix because we are not <b>only asking</b> how effective strategies will be, but <b>also whether</b> farmers will accept them, and what the consequences are for prosperity and wellbeing,’ says Wood.","The impact that increasing productivity can have on farmers’<b> livelihoods </b>is not lost on an insect expert at the University of Ghana, Dr Ken Fening, who is working on an<b>other food</b>-related <b>research project</b>.<b> Cabbages </b>are not<b> indigenous </b>to Africa but <b>have become</b> a major cash crop for Ghanaian farmers and an <b>important source</b> of income for traders from markets and hotels. ‘A good crop can bring in money to buy<b> fertilisers </b>and farm equipment, and <b>also help</b> to pay for healthcare and education for the family,’ he says. Recently, however, fields of stunted, yellowing cabbages, their leaves<b> curled </b>and<b> dotted </b>with mould, <b>have become</b> a familiar and<b> devastating </b>sight for the farmers of Ghana.","From his field station base in Kpong, Ghana, Fening works closely with <b>smallholder farmers</b> on pest-control strategies. <b>Two years</b> ago they started reporting that a new disease was attacking their crops. ‘It seemed to be associated with massive<b> infestations </b>of pink and green aphids,’ says Fening, ‘and from my studies of the way insects interact with <b>many different</b> vegetables, I’m familial* with the types of damage they can cause.’","But farmers were typically seeing the total loss of their crops, and he realised that the devastation couldn’t just be caused by sap-sucking insects. Despite no previous reports of<b> viral </b>diseases affecting<b> cabbage </b>crops in Ghana, the<b> symptoms </b>suggested a<b> viral </b>pathogen.","Together with Cambridge plant biologist Dr John Carr, Fening collected samples of<b> cabbage </b>plants in Ghana showing signs of disease, and also<b> aphids </b>on the diseased plants. Back in Cambridge, Fening used<b> screening </b>techniques including a type of DNA ‘fingerprinting’ to identify the<b> aphid </b>species, and<b> sophisticated </b>molecular biology methods to <b>try to identify</b> the offending virus.","‘Aphids are a common carrier of plant-infecting viruses,’ explains Carr. ‘The “usual suspects” are turnip<b> mosaic </b>virus and cauliflower<b> mosaic </b>virus, which affect<b> cabbages </b>in Europe and the US.’","‘We found that <b>two different</b><b> species </b>of aphids, pink and green, were generally found on the diseased cabbages,’ says Fening. ‘It turned out this was the first record of the green aphid<b> species </b>ever being seen in Ghana.’ The pink<b> aphid </b>was identified as Myzus persicae (Sulzer).","What’s more, the virus was not what they expected, and work is now ongoing to identify the culprit. The sooner it can be characterised, the sooner<b> sustainable </b>crop protection strategies can be developed to prevent further spread of the disease not only in Ghana, but also in <b>other countries</b> in the region. Another researcher who hopes that<b> eradication </b>strategies will be the outcome of her <b>research project</b> is Dr Theresa Manful. Like Fening, she is a researcher at the University of Ghana. She has been working with Cambridge biochemist Professor Mark Carrington on a <b>disease known</b> as trypanosomiasis.","‘This is a major constraint to cattle fearing in Africa,’ she explains. ‘Although<b> trypanosomiasis </b>is also a disease of humans, the number of cases is low, and the more serious concerns about the disease relate to the <b>economic impact</b> on agricultural production.’","The parasite that causes the disease is carried by the tsetse fly, which colonises vast swathes of sub-Saharan Africa. Carrington says that a lot is <b>now known</b> about the parasite’s<b> molecular </b>mechanisms, in particular the way it evades the<b> immune </b>system of the animal acting as its<b> host </b>by altering the proteins in its coat so as to remain ‘invisible’. ‘But then when you look at the effect on large animals, you realise that there is almost nothing known about the dynamics of an infection, and even whether an infection acquired at an early age persists for its lifetime,’ he says. So Manful and Carrington set about testing cattle in Ghana. They discovered that <b>nearly all</b> were infected <b>most of the time</b>.","For Manful, one of the important gains has been the ability to expand the research in Ghana: ‘I <b>now have</b> a <b>fully functional</b> lab and can do DNA extraction and analysis in Ghana -1 don’t have to bring samples to Cambridge. We are teaching students from five Ghanaian institutions the diagnostic methods.’","‘Agriculture faces increasing challenges,’ adds Carr. ‘Bioscience is playing a crucial part in developing ways to<b> mitigate </b>pest impact and reduce the spread of parasites. We want to ensure not only that every harvest is successful, but also that it’s maximally successful.’","——————","* aphids: small insects which feed by sucking liquid from plants."]},{"name":"GRE/14-4","paragraph":["Keep all your bank cards, documents, passports and ID in one of these convenient carriers, which have been selected by Becca Meier.","<b>A </b>   Kipling Travel Doc Travel Document Holder","This zip-around wallet comes in five different patterns and is made of nylon.

The type of delay you can claim for <b>depends on whether</b> the <b>train company</b> runs a <b>Delay Repay</b> scheme or a less generous, older-style scheme.","<b>Delay Repay</b> is a train operator scheme to compensate passengers when trains are late, and the train <b>company will pay</b> out even if it was not<b> responsible </b>for the delay. The scheme varies between companies, but up to 2016 most paid 50 percent of the single ticket cost for 30 minutes’ delay and 100 percent for an hour. On the London Underground, you get a full refund for 15-minute delays.","Companies that do not use <b>Delay Repay</b> and still use the older scheme will not usually pay<b> compensation </b>if the problem is considered to be out of their control. But it is still worth asking them for compensation, as some may pay out. You are <b>unlikely to get</b><b> compensation </b>for a delay if any of the following occur:","•  Accidents involving people getting onto the line illegally","•  Gas leaks or fires in buildings next to the line which were not caused by a <b>train company</b>","•  Line<b> closures </b>at the request of the<b> emergency </b>services","•  Exceptionally severe <b>weather conditions</b>","•  Strike action","National Rail Conditions of Travel state that you are<b> entitled </b>to<b> compensation </b>in the same form that you paid for the ticket. Some train companies are still paying using rail vouchers, which they are allowed to do if you do not ask for a cash refund.","Since 2016, rail passengers have acquired further rights for<b> compensation </b> through the Consumer Rights Act. This means that passengers could now be eligible for<b> compensation </b>due to: a<b> severely </b>overcrowded train with too few<b> carriages </b>available; a consistently late running service; and a service that is delayed for less than the time limit that applied under existing<b> compensation </b>schemes.","However, in order to exercise their rights beyond the existing<b> compensation </b>schemes, for instance <b>Delay Repay</b>, and where the train operating company refuses to compensate despite letters<b> threatening </b>court action, passengers may <b>need to bring</b> their claims to a court of law.","Vacancy for food preparation assistant","Durrant House plc runs <b>restaurants and cafés</b> as<b> concessions </b>in airports, train stations, test centres and other busy environments a<b>round the country</b>.

A partnership is the easier way to <b>get started</b>, and simply links two or more people together in a simple business structure. Unlike a <b>limited company</b>, a partnership doesn’t <b>have a separate</b> legal status. The partners are usually self-employed individuals, although a <b>limited company</b> counts as a ‘legal person’ and can also be a partner.","In a partnership, you and your partner or partners personally share<b> responsibility </b>for your business. This means, among <b>other things</b>, that if your business <b>cannot afford</b> to pay its debts, you must pay them yourselves. Again, this is not the case with a <b>limited company</b>. Partners share the business’s profits, and each partner pays tax on their share.","When you <b>set up</b> a <b>business partnership</b> you need to choose a name. You can trade under your own names, for example, ‘Scotts Tyres’, or you can choose another name for your business. You don’t need to register your name. However, you should register your name as a trademark if you want to <b>stop people</b> from trading under your business name.","<b>Business partnership</b> names must not include ‘limited’, ‘Ltd’, ‘limited liability partnership’, LLP’, ‘public <b>limited company</b>’ or ‘pic’, be offensive, or be the same as an existing trademark. Your name also can’t suggest a connection with government or local authorities, unless you get permission. There is no central database of partnership names in the UK, so to avoid <b>using the same</b> name as another business, it is advisable to search on the internet for the name you are considering.","You must <b>include all</b> the partners’ names and the business name (if you <b>have one</b>) on official paperwork, for example invoices.","You must choose a ‘nominated partner’ who is<b> responsible </b>for registering your partnership with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the government department<b> responsible </b>for the collection of taxes. This person is<b> responsible </b>for managing the partnership’s <b>tax returns</b> and keeping business records. Alternatively, you can appoint an agent to deal with HMRC on your behalf.","All partners need to register with HMRC separately and send their own <b>tax returns</b> as individuals.","You must register by 5 October in your business’s second tax year, or you could be charged a penalty.","You must also register for VAT if your VAT taxable turnover is more than £85,000. You can choose to register if it’s below this, for example to reclaim VAT on business supplies.","THE ROLE OF THE SWISS POSTBUS","Switzerland’s<b> postbuses </b>are much more than just a means of <b>public transport</b>ation.","The Swiss<b> PostBus </b>Limited is the largest of the country’s 78 coach companies. Administered by the Motor <b>Services Department</b> of the <b>Post Office</b>, it carries over 120 million passengers <b>each year</b> and is carefully integrated with other <b>public transport</b> services: trains, boats and mountain cableways. The Swiss transportation system<b> resembles </b>a tree, with the larger branches representing federal and private railways, the smaller branches being the coaches, and the smaller branches being the coaches, and the<b> twigs </b>being the urban transit operators running trams, city buses, boats, chairlifts and so on. But the trunk that holds the tree together is the vast<b> postbus </b>network, without which the whole network would not function.","There isn’t an<b> inhabited </b>place in Switzerland that cannot be reached by <b>some sort</b> of <b>public transport</b>. Federal law and the Swiss Constitution stipulate that every village with a population greater than 40 is<b> entitled </b>to regular bus services. The frequency of these services is directly related to population density. Timetables are put together <b>four years</b> in advance, and seldom change. If a new route is to be introduced, the population of the area affected is invited to vote in a referendum.","At times,<b> postbuses </b>are the main – sometimes the only – links between settlements. These coaches, often with a<b> trailer </b>in two to increase their capacity, are a common sight in high-altitude regions, and their signature sound – part of Rossini’s William Tell Overture, played by the drivers on three-tone post horns with electrical compressors at every road turn – is <b>one of the most</b> familiar Swiss sounds.","The three-tone horns can still be used to ‘talk’ to <b>post office</b>s (and <b>each other</b>) from a distance. By altering the combination of the tones, a driver can announce ‘departure of post’, ‘arrival of post’, ‘arrival of special post’, and so on – so much more<b> romantic </b>and often more reliable than radio or <b>mobile phones</b>. This musical ‘language’ started in the mid-<b>nineteenth century</b>, when the coach drivers could also blow their horns a certain number of times on approaching the station to indicate the number of horses needing to be fed, giving the stationmaster time to prepare the fodder.","The<b> postbus </b>history goes back to 1849, when the Swiss<b> postal </b>service was made a monopoly. The role of today’s modern yellow buses was, back then, played by horse-drawn<b> carriages </b>(or in winter by sleighs, in order to travel on snow), which were the same colour. By 1914, eight years after the first motor coaches were introduced, there were still 2,500 horses, 2,231 coaches (or carriages) and 1,059<b> sleighs </b>in service.","After the <b><b>First World</b> War</b>, Swiss Post bought a<b> fleet </b>of decommissioned military trucks which were converted into postbuses, but it was not until 1961 that the last horse-drawn coach was replaced with a motorised version.","Today, the Swiss <b>Post Office</b> boasts one of the world’s <b>most advanced</b> coach fleets, including fuel-cell models and the world’s first driverless bus. This was launched in 2015 in the town of Sion, the capital of the<b> canton </b>of Valais, one of the 26 cantons, or administrative regions, that <b>make up</b> the country.","Postbuses <b>often go</b> to places that other means of transport cannot reach. Most of the drivers therefore see themselves as educators and tour guides. Although it’s not in their job description, they’re likely to point out the sights – waterfalls, gorges, and so on – and are always ready to pull over for a photo opportunity.","Switzerland’s longest<b> postbus </b>journey, and one of the highest, crosses four <b>mountain passes</b> – an eight-hour trip undertaken by a single postbus. The route goes through several cantons; two languages (German and Italian); all <b>four seasons</b> – from burning<b> sunshine </b>to showers and heavy snowfalls; and countless <b>places of interest</b>. One of the passes, the Gotthard, is often described as ‘the People’s Road’, <b>probably because</b> it connects the German-speaking<b> canton </b>of Uri with Italian-speaking Ticino. Like Switzerland itself,<b> postbuses </b>‘speak’ all four state languages: German, French, Italian and Romansh – and, by law, their automated intercom announcements are given in the language of whichever<b> canton </b>the bus is currently passing through.","Irrespective of their previous driving experience, drivers undergo lots of training. <b>During the first</b> year, they have to drive<b> postbuses </b>under the supervision of a more experienced driver. Only after <b>two years</b> of safe driving in the valleys can they be pronounced ready for a mountain bus.","Some routes are not at all busy, with the bus often carrying just <b>two or three</b> passengers at a time. But for most <b>people living</b> in small mountain villages, the<b> postbus </b>is of the utmost importance. It not only carries the villagers to town and back, it takes village children to and from school, delivers mail, transports milk from the village farms down to the valley, collects rubbish from the village (Swiss laws do not allow dumping anywhere in the mountains), and brings building materials to households. It takes elderly villagers to shops and carries their shopping up the hill to their homes. More a friend than just a means of transportation, for the<b> dwellers </b>of mountain villages the<b> postbus </b>is an essential part of life."]},{"name":"GRE/15-1","paragraph":["<h2>Consumer advice</h2>","What to do if something you ordered hasn’t arrived","If something you’ve ordered hasn’t arrived, you should contact the seller to find out where it is.

Preventing falls from roofs is a priority for WorkSafe <b>New Zealand</b>. Investigation by WorkSafe into falls that occur while working at height show that more than 50 percent of falls are from under three metres, and most of these are from ladders and roofs. The cost of these falls is<b> estimated </b>to be $24 <b>million a year</b> – to say nothing of the human costs that result from these falls. More injuries happen on<b> residential </b>building sites than <b>any other</b> workplace in the construction sector.","In <b>order to prevent</b> such injuries, a<b> hazard </b>assessment should be carried out for all work on roofs to assess potential dangers. It is essential that the<b> hazards </b>are identified before the work starts, and that the necessary equipment, appropriate<b> precautions </b>and systems of work are provided and implemented.<b> Hazard </b>identification should be repeated<b> periodically </b>or when there is a change in conditions, for example, the weather or numbers of staff onsite.","The <b>first thing</b> to be considered is whether it is possible to eliminate this<b> hazard </b>completely, so that workers are not exposed to the danger of falling. This can sometimes be done at the design, construction planning, and tendering stage. If the possibility of a fall cannot be eliminated, some form of edge protection should be used to prevent workers from falling. It may be possible to use the existing scaffolding as edge protection. If this is not practicable, then<b> temporary </b>work platforms should be used. In cases where such protection is not possible, then steps should be taken to minimise the<b> likelihood </b>of any harm resulting. This means considering the use of safety nets and other similar systems to make it <b>less likely</b> that injury will be caused if a fall does occur.","Ladders should only be employed for short-duration<b> maintenance </b>work such as touching up paint. <b>People using</b> ladders should be trained and instructed in the selection and safe use of ladders.

At the time, Marshall was <b>working to build</b> a water-powered sawmill for businessman John Sutter. As it happens, just days after Marshall’s discovery, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed, ending the Mexican-American War and<b> transferring </b>California, with its mineral deposits, into the ownership of the <b>United States</b>. At the time, the population of the<b> territory </b>consisted of 6,500 Californios (people of Spanish or Mexican descent); 700 foreigners (primarily Americans); and 150,000 Native Americans.","<b>B</b>","Though Marshall and Sutter tried to keep news of the discovery quiet, word got out, and by mid-March 1848 at <b>least one</b> newspaper was reporting that large quantities of gold were being found. Though the initial reaction in <b>San Francisco</b> was disbelief, storekeeper Sam Brannan set off a frenzy when he paraded through town displaying a small bottle containing gold from Sutter’s Creek. By mid-June, some three-quarters of the male population of <b>San Francisco</b> had left town for the gold mines, and the number of miners in the area reached 4,000 by August.","<b>C</b>","As news spread of the fortunes being made in California, the first migrants to arrive were those from lands accessible by boat, such as Oregon, the Sandwich Islands (now Hawaii), Mexico, Chile, Peru and even China. Only later would the news reach the <b>East Coast</b>, where press reports were initially skeptical. Throughout 1849, <b>thousands of people</b> around the <b>United States</b> (mostly men) borrowed money, mortgaged their property or spent their life savings to make the arduous journey to California. In pursuit of the kind of wealth they <b>had never</b> dreamed of, they left their families and local areas; in turn, their wives <b>had no</b> option but to shoulder different<b> responsibilities </b>such as running farms or businesses, and many made a real success of them.","By the <b>end of the year</b>, the non-native population of California was<b> estimated </b>at 100,000 (as compared with 20,000 at the end of 1848 and around 800 in March 1848). To accommodate the needs of the ‘49ers, as the gold miners were known, towns had sprung <b>up all</b> over the region, complete with shops and other businesses seeking to make their own Gold Rush fortune. The overcrowded chaos of the mining camps and towns grew ever more lawless. <b>San Francisco</b>, for its part, developed a<b> bustling </b>economy and became the central<b> metropolis </b>of the new frontier.","<b>D</b>","How did all these would-be miners search for gold? Panning was the oldest way. The basic procedure was to place some gold-bearing material, such as river gravel, into a shallow pan, add <b>some water</b>, and then carefully swirl the mixture around so the water and light material<b> spilled </b>over the side. If all went well, the heavier gold nuggets or gold dust would settle to the bottom of the pan. Gold panning was slow even for the most skillful miner. On a good day, one miner could wash about 50 pans in the usual 12-hour workday.","<b>E</b>","<b>Another way</b> was to use what was called a ‘rocker’. Isaac Humphrey is said to <b>have introduced</b> it to the California gold fields. It was simply a rectangular wooden box, set at a downward angle and<b> mounted </b>on a rocking mechanism. The dirt and rock was<b> dumped </b>into the top, followed by a bucket of water. The box was rocked by hand to agitate the mixture. The <b>big rock</b>s were caught in a sieve at the top, the waste exited the lower and with the water, and the heavy gold fell to the bottom of the box.","The rocker had advantages and disadvantages. The advantages were that it was easily transportable; it did not require a constant source of water; and, <b>most important</b>ly, a miner could process more dirt and rock than with a pan. The primary disadvantage was that the rocker <b>had difficulty</b> in trapping the smallest particles of gold, <b>commonly known</b> as ‘flour’. Some miners added small amounts of<b> mercury </b>to the bottom of the rocker. Due to its chemical composition, it had a<b> facility </b>to trap fine gold. Periodically, the miners would remove and heat it. As it vaporized, it would leave gold behind.","<b>F</b>","After 1850, the surface gold in California <b>had large</b>ly disappeared, even as miners continued to reach the gold fields. Mining <b>had always</b> been difficult and dangerous labor, and striking it rich required <b>good luck</b> as much as skill and <b>hard work</b>. Moreover, the average daily pay for an independent miner had by then dropped sharply from what it had been in 1848. As gold became more and more difficult to reach, the growing industrialization of mining drove more and more miners from independence into wage labor. The new technique of<b> hydraulic </b>mining, developed in 1853, brought enormous profits, but destroyed much of the region’s landscape.","<b>G</b>","Though gold mining continued throughout the 1850s, it had reached its peak by 1852, when gold worth some $81 million was pulled from the ground. After that year, the total take declined gradually, leveling off to around $45 million <b>per year</b> by 1857. Settlement in California continued, however, and by the end of the decade the state’s population was 380,000"]},{"name":"GRE/15-2","paragraph":["<h2>Harvey’s Storage</h2>","Harvey’s Storage is a well-established independent company.

It is important to <b>take all</b> reasonably practicable measure to keep customers and yourself incident and injury free.","Biohazard waste","Plumbers regularly come into contact with biohazard waste. It’s the nature of the job, but that doesn’t mean you should be complacent about it. According to Safe Work Australia, communicable diseases from work-related exposures to biological<b> hazards </b>such as<b> sewage </b>have been<b> estimated </b>to cause 320,000<b> deaths </b>across the globe <b>each year</b>. In addition to this,<b> plumbers </b>are regularly exposed to other biohazards such as mould,<b> bacteria </b>and algae. Don’t risk it – <b>make sure</b> appropriate <b>clothing and equipment</b> is used.","<b>Confined spaces</b>","Plumbers may spend much of their <b>time working</b> in <b>confined spaces</b>, where they are at risk from contaminants, including airborne gases, vapours and dusts, that may cause injury from fire or explosion. They may also be exposed to high<b> concentration </b>of airborne<b> contaminants </b>that may be harmful to health. For example, one plumber was fined $220,000 after an employee suffered from carbon-monoxide poisoning. Another potential<b> hazard </b>for<b> plumbers </b>in <b>confined spaces</b> is that of drowning, if <b>water source</b>s are not adequately cut off.","The Safe Work Australia <b>confined spaces</b> code of practice outlines the necessary steps and<b> precautions </b>for avoiding<b> illness </b>and injury.","Electricity","The Master Plumbers’ Association calls electricity ‘plumbing’s hidden killer’. Metal pipes are often conductive and so gloves which provide<b> insulation </b>should form part of a plumber’s tool kit, as should a<b> plumbing </b>voltage monitor and a volt tester. Gloves should be checked prior to every use and replaced every 12 to 14 months. Electrical equipment like bridging conductors should be regularly checked, with appropriate tags on the equipment to verify its safety. The project should be stopped immediately if there is <b>any sign</b> of electricity, so that the power can be disconnected by a qualified electrician prior to continuing work.","Questions 15-20","How to manage <b>flexible working</b> with your employees","There is no denying that <b>flexible working</b> <b>has grown</b> enormously in <b>recent years</b>. It does, however, require careful management.","When it comes to implementing <b>flexible working</b> one word is key: trust. All flexible workers should be trusted and given well-defined objectives from the start and their contribution should be assessed according to their output, as<b> opposed </b>to the time they spend on the job. It can be a big step to implement such as change in your business, so if you are slightly cautious then I recommend perhaps <b>setting up</b> an end-of-the-day review to see how much progress <b>has been made</b>. As all parties find their feet with the new set-up, this contact can slowly be reduced.","In my eyes, it is also vital that there is shared calendar access for everyone so that people can see where their colleagues are <b>each day</b>. This way if they need to catch up with someone they can plan when to do so. Technology now exists to enable employees to <b>stay in touch</b> with <b>other <b>members of staff</b></b> and<b> external </b>partners. iMeet, for example, is a tool which allows all forms of collaboration for remote working, from video conferencing, live chat and file sharing to screen sharing. The new breed of worker is therefore <b>fully equipped</b> to work productively away from the office, and can still <b>feel like</b> they’re in the same room as others when necessary.","In my experience, employees are often more productive working at home as they can work the exact hours they want and <b>do not have</b> to cope with distraction caused by <b>other employees</b>. Being outside the confines of the office <b>walls also</b> appears to<b> foster </b>creativity. In addition, we find staff are more motivated as they have a better work-life balance. In terms of the business, we find this helps with top talent<b> recruitment </b>and staff retention, and a happy workforce is a more successful one.","Preventing the theft of <b>turtle eggs</b>","<b><b>Conservationists and law</b> enforcement</b> have struggled to prevent wildlife trafficking. But could some plastic eggs and GPS trackers change the game?","<b>A</b>","<b>Humans have</b> been eating <b>sea <b>turtle eggs</b></b> (and killing adult turtles for meat) for millennia. However, as human populations exploded and as <b><b>sea turtle</b>s</b> began to confront additional threats such as intensive fishing, beach development and <b>climate change</b>, <b>sea turtle</b> populations declined precipitously. Today, all but one of the world’s seven<b> species </b>of <b><b>sea turtle</b>s</b> are considered<b> threatened </b>according to the IUCN* Red List. And the one that’s not – the flatback turtle – is listed as data deficient, which means scientists simply don’t know how it’s doing.","<b>B</b>","<b>One major</b> problem is that <b>every year</b> millions of <b>sea <b>turtle eggs</b></b> are illegally taken by<b> poachers </b>for sale on the black market. The situation is particularly serious in Nicaragua, in Central America, which is home to four <b>sea turtle</b> species.","Kim Williams-Guillen, who works for conservation body <b>Paso Pacifico</b>, described the<b> poaching </b>of <b>sea turtle</b> nests on the beaches of Nicaragua as ‘uncontrolled, unregulated, extensive and contested’. Even the best-protected beaches are plundered to <b>some extent</b> and it’s not uncommon to see<b> poachers </b>digging up nests just meters from tourists watching <b><b>sea turtle</b>s</b> laying their clutch at night, she said. This<b> poaching </b>becomes particularly frenzied during the<b> arribadas </b>– mass laying events where thousands of turtles nest on the same beach for a single night in a biological strategy to<b> overwhelm </b>natural predators.","<b>C</b>","‘Even with armed guards, the numbers of poachers<b> overwhelm </b>military<b> personnel </b>by ten to twenty to one,’ Williams-Guillen said. ‘<b>Although many</b><b> poachers </b>are locals with limited resources, during these<b> arribadas </b>there are influxes of gangs of<b> poachers </b>from larger cities outside local communities. These are not just local poor people without other options.’","But to protect the country’s <b><b>sea turtle</b>s</b>, Williams-Guillen said<b> conservationists </b>shouldn’t just depend on catching low-level operators. ‘If one<b> poacher </b>decides to stop, <b>an<b>other one</b></b> will just step into his place… we <b>need to know</b> more about the<b> middlemen </b>and people <b>higher up</b> in the distribution chain,’ she said.","<b>D</b>","<b>Paso Pacifico</b>’s solution is the creation of high-tech <b>sea <b>turtle eggs</b></b>: <b>fake eggs</b> convincingly<b> crafted </b>to look like the real thing, but which contain GPS tracking devices. These have the potential to reveal the destination markets for trafficked <b>sea <b>turtle eggs</b></b>.","Making convincing <b>sea <b>turtle eggs</b></b> is not easy, and <b>Paso Pacifico</b> is <b>still working</b> on perfecting a prototype. In particular, it’s proving quite<b> problematic </b>to create the right texture, since <b>sea <b>turtle eggs</b></b> are not covered in a hard shell like those of birds, but are quite flexible.","So <b>Paso Pacifico</b> brought in Lauren Wilde, a special effects artist in the US, to create a convincing outer shell. First, Wilde had to get her hands on the real thing. Since it’s illegal to send <b>sea <b>turtle eggs</b></b> over the border, Wilde is using land <b>turtle eggs</b> from California. ‘It was really eye opening and important for me to feel these eggs and how the shell bends a little,’ she said.","To get the GPS device inside the shell, <b>Paso Pacifico</b> is using 3D printers to make a plastic ball which will then have a GPS<b> transmitter </b>fitted inside. This will take the place of the<b> embryo </b>inside the shell. Lastly the fake shells will be<b> sealed </b>with silicone, waterproofing them.","<b>E</b>","<b><b>Sea turtle</b>s</b> on average lay around 100 eggs in a nest, and once the <b>fake eggs</b> are finished they will be<b> slipped </b>in with the real ones. Williams-Guillen said it might even be possible to deliver <b>fake eggs</b> into nests while<b> poachers </b>are at work. Wary of tourists,<b> poachers </b>will often back off if strangers come near and then return when they <b>have gone</b>. ‘It would be pretty easy to drop an egg in the dark into a nest they have been<b> digging </b>up,’ she said.","Once the<b> poacher </b>picks up the fake egg along with the real ones, <b><b>conservationists and law</b> enforcement</b> agents will be <b>able to track</b> them. Experts believe most of the stolen eggs eventually <b>make their way</b> out of Nicaragua, possibly to El Salvador or Guatemala. However, there is also growing concern that <b>sea <b>turtle eggs</b></b> from Central America are actually heading to the USA, from where they are sold on to <b>other countries</b> a<b>round the world</b>.","<b>F</b>","To date, <b>Paso Pacifico</b> has yet to put a single fake egg in a nest. But Williams-Guillen said she isn’t too concerned that publicity for their scheme will result in<b> poachers </b>looking for the eggs. ‘The <b>vast majority</b> of the<b> poaching </b>is happening at night, so already it is hard to tell [the eggs] apart, and at this point,<b> poachers </b>and<b> middlemen </b>are not closely inspecting eggs, but rather shoving them into a sack as quickly as possible.’","Of course,<b> poachers </b>will eventually become aware of the prospect of <b>fake eggs</b> among the real ones – especially when customers try to bite into an egg and break their teeth on the GPS<b> transmitter </b>instead. So, <b>Paso Pacifico</b> plans to do a massive deployment of as many fakes as possible to gather a lot of data before<b> poachers </b>get wise.","Knowing where the eggs go will allow <b><b>conservationists and law</b> enforcement</b> agents to focus their resources on the right places – whether it be through awareness-building campaigns or crackdowns on illegal sellers. And eventually <b>Paso Pacifico</b> hopes to share the technology with interested parties a<b>round the world</b>.","——","*IUCN: International Union for Conservation of Nature"]},{"name":"GRE/15-3","paragraph":["<h2>Young Fashion Designer UK competition</h2>","<b>Young <b>Fashion Designer</b></b> UK is an exciting national competition which aims to showcase and promote the exceptional work achieved by students studying courses in<b> textile </b>design, product design and fashion throughout the UK.","The competition is designed for students to enter the coursework they are currently working on rather than specifically producing different pieces of work.

However, working for a small or medium-sized business has many advantages that are too easily overlooked. <b><b>Here are just</b> a few</b> of them.","Working in a small organisation with a small workforce means it’s likely to be easy to become part of it. It won’t be long before you’re familiar with the staff and the departments that you <b>need to deal</b> with. This can provide a feeling of comfort that takes much longer to develop in a large company. Departments are likely to be small and have close connections with <b>each other</b>, which helps to make internal communication <b>work well</b> – <b>everyone knows</b> what’s going on. You’ll <b>also gain</b> a <b>better understanding</b> of how your own role fits into the <b>company as a whole</b>.","In a small business you’re <b>likely to have</b> considerable variety in your workload, including<b> opportunities </b>to work in <b>different areas</b> of the company, which will allow you to identify abilities that you didn’t know you had. An introduction to new activities could <b>even lead</b> to a change of career. This variety in your work will help to make it stimulating, so you <b><b>have a go</b>od</b> reason for getting out of bed in the morning.","There will be <b>plenty of opportunities</b> to show initiative, and you’ll also learn to function well as <b>part of a team</b>. Because it’s much harder to overlook someone within a small workforce than a large one, your efforts are more likely to attract the attention of those <b>higher up</b>. You’ll <b>have plenty</b> of opportunity to show what you can do, and to have your potential noticed. The result is very likely to be that promotion comes to you faster.","<b>Small businesses</b> are usually flexible, something that is rarely true of large organisations. This means that if they’re well managed, they can adapt to <b>make the most</b> of changes in the wider economy, which in turn can help you. Don’t dismiss them as a place to work because of the<b> myths </b>about them. Small firms can be ideal places for developing your career.","<b><b>Starting a new</b> job</b>","<b>A</b>","<b>Make <b>sure you know</b></b> when and where you are expected to report on your <b>first day</b>. If the route from home is unfamiliar to you, make a practice run first: the normal first activity in a <b>new job</b> is a meeting with your boss, and it would be embarrassing to be late. <b>Dress formally</b> until you’re sure of the <b>dress code</b>.","<b>B</b>","You should expect to have an<b> induction </b>programme planned for you: a security pass; visits to whatever parts of the organisation you <b>need to understand</b> to do your job properly; meetings with anyone who could affect your success in the role; and someone to show you where everything is and tell you all the real rules of the culture – the ones that are never written down but which everyone is meant to follow.","<b>C</b>","It can be a shock to join a new organisation. When you are a newcomer, feeling uncertain and perhaps a little confused, there can be a strong temptation to talk about your old job and organisation as a way of reminding yourself and telling others that you <b>really know</b> what you are doing, because you did it in your previous role. Unfortunately, this will suggest that you have a high opinion of yourself, and that you think your old place was better. It has enormous power to annoy, so don’t do it.","<b>D</b>","All employers have a core <b>product or service</b> paid for by customers which justifies their existence. If you are not part of this core activity, remember that your <b>role is to provide</b> a service to the people who are part of it.

But <b>no matter</b> how well they have<b> stuck </b>to their training regime, contestants will find that running non-stop for 42 kilometres is going to hurt.","Now consider the<b> barnacle </b>goose. <b>Every year</b> this bird carries out a 3000-kilometre migration. So how do the birds prepare for this? Do they spend months gradually building up fitness? That’s not really the<b> barnacle </b>goose’s style. instead, says environmental<b> physiologist </b>Lewis Halsey, ‘They just basically sit on the water and eat a lot.’","<b>Until recently</b>, nobody had really asked whether exercise is as tightly connected to fitness in the rest of the <b>animal kingdom</b> as it is for us. The question is tied up in a broader assumption: that animals maintain fitness because of the exercise they get finding food and escaping predators.","Halsey points out that this may not necessarily be the case. Take the house cat. Most domestic cats spend much of the day lounging around, apparently doing nothing, rather than<b> hunting </b>for food. But over short distances, even the laziest can move incredibly fast when they want to. Similarly, black and <b>brown bears</b> manage to come out of several months’ hibernation with their muscle mass intact – without having to lift so much as a paw during this time.","Barnacle<b> geese </b>go one better. In the process of sitting around, they don’t just maintain their fitness. They also develop stronger hearts and bigger flight muscles, enabling them to fly for thousands of kilometres in a migration that may last as little as <b>two days</b>.","So, if exercise isn’t necessarily the key to physical strength, then what is? one clue comes from a broader view of the meaning of <b>physical fitness</b>. Biologically speaking, all it means is that the body has undergone changes that make it stronger and more efficient. In animals such as bears these changes appear to be triggered by<b> cues </b>such as falling<b> temperatures </b>or insufficient food. In the months of hibernation, these factors seem to prompt the release of muscle-protecting<b> compounds </b>which are then carried to the bears’ muscles in their blood and prevent muscle loss.","Barnacle geese, Halsey suggests, may be responding to an <b>environmental change</b> such as temperature, which helps their bodies somehow ‘know’ that a big <b>physical challenge</b> is looming. In <b>other bird</b> species, that<b> cue </b>may be something different. Chris Guglielmo, a physiological ecologist, has studied the effect of subjecting<b> migratory </b>songbirds known as yellow-rumped warblers to changing hours of daylight. ‘We don’t <b>need to take</b> little<b> songbirds </b>and train them up to do a 6- or 10-hour flight,’ he says. If they are subjected to the right daylight cycle, ‘we can take them out of the cage and put them in the wind tunnel, and they fly for 10 hours.’","Unlike<b> migratory </b>birds, however, <b>humans have</b> no biological shortcut to getting fit. Instead, pressures in our evolutionary history made our bodies tie fitness to exercise.","Our ancestor’s lives were unpredictable. They <b>had to do</b> a lot of running to catch food and escape danger, but they also <b>needed to keep</b> muscle mass to a minimum because muscle is biologically expensive. Each kilogram contributes about 10 to 15 kilocalories a day to our metabolism when resting – which doesn’t <b>sound like</b> much until you realise that muscles account for about 40 percent of the average person’s body mass. ‘Most of us are spending 20 percent of our basic energy budget taking care of muscle mass,’ says Daniel Lieberman, an evolutionary biologist and<b> marathon </b>runner.","So our physiology evolved to let our weight and fitness fluctuate depending on how much food was available. ‘This makes us evolutionarily <b>different from most</b> <b>other animals</b>,’ says Lieberman. In general, animals merely need to be capable of short bouts of intense activity, whether it’s the cheetah chasing<b> prey </b>or the gazelle escaping. Cats are fast, but they don’t need to run <b>very far</b>. Perhaps a few mad dashes around the house are all it takes to keep a domestic one fit enough for feline purposes. ‘Humans, on the other hand, needed to adapt to run slower, but for longer,’ says Lieberman.","He argues that long ago on the African savannah, natural selection made us into ‘supremely adapted’ endurance athletes, capable of running<b> prey </b>into the ground and ranging over <b>long distances</b> with<b> unusual </b>efficiency. But only, it appears, if we train. Otherwise we quickly degenerate into couch potatoes.","As for speed, even those animals that do cover<b> impressive </b>distances don’t have to be the fastest they can possibly be.<b> Barnacle </b>geese needn’t set world records when crossing the North Atlantic; they just <b>need to be able</b> to get to their destination. ‘And’, says exercise<b> physiologist </b>Ross Tucker, ‘humans may be the only animal that actually cares about reaching peak performance.’ Other than racehorses and greyhounds, both of which we have bred to race, animals aren’t directly competing against <b>one another</b>. ‘I don’t know that all animals are the same, performance-wise … and we don’t know whether training would enhance their ability,’ he says."]},{"name":"GRE/15-4","paragraph":["<h2>New cycle path to Marshbrook Country Park</h2>","<b>A</b>","<b>A </b> new dual-purpose cycle and<b> pedestrian </b>route <b>has been built</b> from Atherton bus station to the country park’s <b>main entrance</b> at Marshbrook.

In the <b>long run</b> it could get you in more trouble than you realise.","When you’re trying to focus on something, hunger is the worst thing. If you can, keep some healthy snacks in your desk because if you <b><b>have some</b>thing</b> you can nibble on, it will make you work more effectively and you’ll enjoy it more. also, if you’re dehydrated, you won’t be able to focus properly.

You are perhaps the <b>most <b>important part</b></b> in the ‘promotion process’, so you need to <b>know what you want</b> – and why you want it. Take an honest look at yourself – your achievements and also your skills, particularly those you could<b> exploit </b>to take on a <b>different role</b>.","Your boss is the gatekeeper. If you think your boss is likely to be on your side, ask for a meeting to discuss your serious commitment to the organisation and how this could translate into a more defined career plan. If you are less sure about your boss’s view of your prospects and how they may react, start softly with a more deliberate focus on increasing your boss’s understanding of the work you do and the added value you deliver.","Think about how you are perceived at work. In order for you to get your promotion, who needs to know about you? Who would be on the interview panel and whose opinion and input would they seek? And once you’ve got a list of people to impress, <b>ask yourself</b> – do they know enough about you? And I mean <b>really know</b> – what you do day to day at your desk, your contribution to the team, and perhaps <b>most important</b>ly, your potential.","The chances are that those decision-makers won’t <b>know all</b> they should about you. Raising your profile in your organisation is critical so that when those in charge <b>start looking</b> at that empty office and considering how best to fill it, the first name that pops into their heads is yours. If your firm has a newsletter, volunteer to write a feature to include in it. If they arrange regular client events, <b>get involved</b> in the organisation of them. And so on.","If you think your experience needs enhancing, then look at ways you can continue to improve it. If you are confident in your professional expertise but lack the latest management theory, enrol on some<b> relevant </b>courses that fit around your day job.","So what are you waiting for?","Animals can tell right from wrong","<b>Until recently</b>, humans were thought to be the only<b> species </b>to experience complex emotions and <b>have a sense</b> of morality. But Professor Marc Bekoff, an<b> ecologist </b>at University of Colorado, Boulder, US, believes that<b> morals </b>are ‘hard-wired’ into the brains of all mammals and provide the ‘social glue’ that allows animals to live together in groups.","His conclusions will assist animal welfare groups pushing to have animals treated more humanely. Professor Bekoff, who presents his case in his book Wild Justice, said: ‘Just as in humans, the moral nuances of a particular culture or group will be different from another, but they are certainly there. Moral codes are<b> species </b>specific, so they can be difficult to compare with <b>each other</b> or with humans.’ Professor Bekoff believes<b> morals </b>developed in animals to help regulate behaviour in<b> social </b>groups. He claims that these help to limit fighting within the group and encourage co-operative behaviour.","His ideas <b>have met</b> with some<b> controversy </b>in the <b>scientific community</b>. Professor Frans de Waal, who examines the behaviour of primates, including chimpanzees, at Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, US, said: ‘I don’t believe animals are moral in the sense we humans are – with a well-developed and reasoned sense of right and wrong – rather that human<b> morality </b>incorporates a set of<b> psychological </b>tendencies and capacities such as empathy, reciprocity, a desire for co-operation and harmony that are older than our species. Human<b> morality </b>was not formed from scratch, but grew out of our primate psychology. Primate<b> psychology </b>has ancient roots, and I agree that order animals show many of the same<b> tendencies </b>and have an intense sociality.’","Wolves live in tight-knit<b> social </b>groups that are regulated by strict rules.<b> Wolves </b>also demonstrate fairness. During play,<b> dominant </b>wolves will appear to exchange roles with lower-ranking wolves. They pretend to be<b> submissive </b>and go so far as to allow biting by the lower-ranking wolves, provided it is not too hard. Prof Bekoff argues that without a moral code governing their actions, this kind of behaviour would not be possible. Astonishingly, if an animal becomes aggressive, it will perform a ‘play bow’ to ask forgiveness before play resumes.","In <b>other members</b> of the dog family, play is controlled in a similar way. Among coyotes, cubs which are too aggressive are ignored by the rest of the group and often <b>end up</b> having to leave entirely. Experiments with domestic dogs, where one animal was given some ‘sweets’ and another wasn’t, <b>have shown</b> that they possess a sense of fairness as they allowed their companion to eat some.","Elephants are intensely<b> sociable </b>and emotional animals. Research by Iain Douglas-Hamilton, from the department of zoology at Oxford University, suggests elephants experience compassion and has <b>found evidence</b> of elephants helping injured members of their herd. In 2003, a<b> herd </b>of 11 elephants rescued<b> antelopes </b>which were being held inside an enclosure in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The top female elephant unfastened all of the metal latches holding the gates closed and swung them open, allowing the<b> antelopes </b>to escape. This is thought to be a rare example of animals showing<b> empathy </b>for members of an<b>other species</b> – a trait <b>previously thought</b> to be the<b> exclusive </b>preserve of humankind.","<b>A </b><b> laboratory </b>experiment involved training Diana monkeys to insert a token into a<b> slot </b>to obtain food. A male who <b>had become</b> skilled at the task was found to be helping the oldest female, who <b>had no</b>t learned how to do it. On three occasions the male money <b>picked up</b> tokens she dropped and inserted them into the<b> slot </b>and allowed her to have the food. As there was no benefit for the male monkey, Professor Bekoff argues that this is a clear example of an animal’s actions being driven by some internal moral compass.","Since chimpanzees are known to be among the most cognitively advanced of the great apes and our closet cousins, it is perhaps not remarkable that scientist should suggest they live by moral codes. A<b> chimpanzee </b>known as Knuckles is the only known captive<b> chimpanzee </b>to suffer from cerebral palsy, which leaves him physically and<b> mentally </b>impaired. What is extraordinary is that <b>scientists have</b> observed other chimpanzees interacting with him differently and he is rarely subjected to<b> intimidating </b>displays of aggression from older males. Chimpanzees also demonstrate a sense of justice and those who deviate from the code of conduct of a group are <b>set up</b>on by <b>other members</b> as punishment.","Experiments with rats <b>have shown</b> that they will not take food if they know their actions will cause pain to another rat. In lab tests, rats were given food which then caused a second group of rats to receive an electric shock. The rats with the food stopped eating rather than see this happen.","Whales <b>have been found</b> to have <b>spindle cells</b> in their brains. These specialised cells were thought to be restricted to humans and great apes, and appear to play a role in<b> empathy </b>and understanding the emotions of others. Humpback whales, fin whales, killer whales and<b> sperm </b>whales <b>have all</b> been <b>found to have</b> <b>spindle cells</b>. They <b>also have</b> <b>three times</b> as many <b>spindle cells</b> as humans and are thought to be older in evolutionary terms. This finding suggests that emotional judgements such as<b> empathy </b>may <b>have evolved</b> considerably earlier in history than formerly thought and could be widespread in the <b>animal kingdom</b>."]},{"name":"GRE/16-1","paragraph":["Helping pupils to choose optional subjects when they’re aged 14-15: what some pupils say","<b>A.</b>  Krishnan","I’m studying Spanish, because it’s important to learn foreign languages – and I’m <b>very pleased</b> when I can watch a video in class and understand it .

There are always jobs to be done and some tasks require physical manual work. While it is good for people to be active , there are risk factors associated with this, and efforts need to be made to reduce them.","The first risk relates to the carrying of an<b> excessive </b>load or weight. This places undue demands on the<b> spine </b>and can cause <b>permanent damage</b>. Examples of tasks that involve this risk are moving 5Okilogramme<b> fertiliser </b>bags from <b>one site</b> to another or carrying heavy buckets of animal feed around fields. According to the UK <b><b>Health and Safety</b> Executive</b>, <b>activities such</b> as these ‘should be avoided at <b><b>all time</b>s</b>’.","Their documentation states that other methods should be considered, such as breaking down the load into smaller containers prior to movement or transporting the materials using a tractor or other vehicle. The risk posed by<b> excessive </b>force is <b>made worse</b> if the person lifting is also bending over as this increases pressure on the discs in the back.","If a load is bulky or hard to grasp, such as a lively or agitated animal, it will be more difficult to hold while lifting and carrying. The holder may adopt an awkward posture, which is tiring and increases the risk of injury. Sometimes a load has to be held away from the body because there is a large obstacle in the area and the person lifting needs to be able to see where their feet are going. This results in increased stress on the back; holding a load at arm’s length imposes about <b>five times</b> the stress of a close-to-the-body position. In such cases, handling aids should be purchased that can take the weight off the load and minimise the potential for injury.","Another risk that relates to awkward<b> posture </b>is<b> repetitive </b>bending when carrying out a task. An example might be repairing a gate that has collapsed onto the ground. This type of activity increases the stress on the lower back because the back muscles have to support the weight of the upper body. The farmer should think about whether the job can be performed on a workbench, reducing the need for prolonged awkward posture.","Good <b>customer service</b> in retail","Without customers, your retail business would not exist. It stands to reason, therefore, that how you treat your customers has a direct impact on your <b>profit margins</b>. Some customers <b>just want</b> to browse and not be<b> bothered </b>by sales staff.","Try to be sensitive to how much help a customer wants; b<b> proactive </b>in offering help without being annoying. Suggest a product that naturally accompanies what the customer is considering or point out products for which there are special offers, but don’t pressure a customer into buying an item they don’t want.","<b>Build up</b> a<b> comprehensive </b>knowledge of all the products in your shop, including the pros and cons of product s that are alike but that have been produced under a range of brand names. If you have run out of a particular item, <b>make <b>sure you know</b></b> when the next orders are corning in. Negativity can put customers off instantly. If a customer asks a question to which the answer is ‘no’, do not <b>just leave</b> it at that – follow it with a positive, for example: ‘we’re expecting more of that product in on Tuesday’.","Meanwhile, if you see a product in the wrong place on a shelf, don’t ignore it – put it back where it belongs . This attention to presentation keeps the<b> shop </b>tidy, giving the right impression to your","customers. Likewise, if you notice a fault with a product, remove it and replace it with another.","When necessary, be discreet.","For example, if the customer’s <b>credit card</b> is declined at the till, keep your voice down and enquire about an alternative payment method quietly so that the customer doesn’t feel humiliated. If they experience uncomfortable emotions in your shop, it’s unlikely that they’ll <b>come back</b>.","Finally, good manners are <b>probably the most</b> important aspect of dealing with customers. Treat <b>each person</b> with respect at <b><b>all time</b>s</b>, even when you are faced with rudeness. Being discourteous yourself will only add more<b> fuel </b>to the fire.","Build a reputation for polite, helpful staff and you’ll find that customers not only keep giving you their custom, but <b>also tell</b> their friends about you.","Qualities that make a <b>great barista</b>","Truly <b>great barista</b>s <b>take the time</b> to develop the key skills that will enable them to deliver the highest possible quality of coffee-based beverage and service. As a barista, you must make a concerted effort to listen to your clientele and <b>make sure</b> the drinks you produce are correct in all respects. This is <b>particularly important</b> when you consider the<b> sheer </b>range and complexity of modern coffee drinks, which may start from a single (or double) shot of<b> espresso </b>but can include many additional elements. If you become distracted by the conversation that is going on nearby, you may ultimately miss the mark from a service perspective.","<b>One thing</b> that separates a great from a good<b> barista </b>is that the former is constantly busy and has a strong work ethic. You will often catch a <b>great barista</b> rinsing out the filter in their machines, for example, as this erodes the build-up of burnt coffee oil that can begin to impact on the quality and taste of each<b> espresso </b>shot. Similarly, do not be surprised to hear the sound of the coffee grinder at work. This highlights the keen attention to detail that distinguishes skilled baristas, as they have the desire and the awareness to <b>make every</b> drink with completely fresh ground coffee. This type of<b> attentiveness </b>helps<b> baristas </b>to get the most from the coffee that they use, as many of the delicate aromas found in<b> espresso </b>are lost when exposed to the <b>open air</b>.","Timing is everything when it comes to producing the perfect <b>cup of coffee</b>. A <b>great barista</b> knows precisely when to finish the extraction of espresso, at the point when the balance of flavour has reached its<b> optimum </b>levels. They also understand how important this is; those who act too soon are left with a drink without flavour while those who delay the finish risk burning the beverage and tainting it with a bitter after-taste.","When it comes to <b>customer service</b>, there is so much more to a coffee<b> shop </b>experience than drinking perfectly roasted blends. The atmosphere and the<b> ambience </b>also play a central role, and the interaction that the customer has with their<b> barista </b>sets the tone for an <b>enjoyable experience</b>. <b>Great barista</b>s ask their customers how their day is going or what they’re <b>going to do</b> later; they read <b>local newspapers</b> and <b>keep up</b> with issues that really matter, all of which make a real difference in a competitive marketplace."]},{"name":"GRE/16-2","paragraph":["<h2>Plastic is no longer fantastic</h2>","<b>A.</b>  In 2017, Carlos Ferrando, a Spanish engineer-turned-entrepreneur, saw a piece of art in a museum that profoundly affected him. ‘What Lies Under’, a photographic<b> composition </b>by Indonesian digital artist Ferdi Rizkiyanto, shows a child crouching by the edge of the ocean and ‘lifting up’ a wave, to reveal a cluster of assorted plastic waste, from polyethylene bags to <b>water bottles</b>. The artwork, designed to raise public awareness, left Ferrando angry – and<b> fuelled </b>with<b> entrepreneurial </b>ideas.","<b>B.</b>  Ferrando runs a Spanish-based design company, Closca, that produces an<b> ingenious </b>foldable bicycle helmet. But he <b><b>has no</b>w</b> also designed a<b> stylish </b>glass water bottle with a stretchy<b> silicone </b>strap and magnetic closure mechanism that means it can be attached to <b>almost any</b>thing, from a bike to a bag to a pushchair handle. The product comes with an app that tells people where they can fill their bottles with water for free.","<b>C.</b>  The intention is to <b>persuade people</b> to <b>stop buying</b> water in plastic bottles, thus saving consumers money and reducing the plastic waste piling up in our oceans. ‘Bottled water is now a $100 billion business, and 81 <b>per cent</b> of the bottles are not<b> recycled </b>. It’s a complete waste – water is only 1.5 percent of the price of the bottle!’ Ferrando cries. Indeed, environmentalists<b> estimate </b>that by 2050 there will be more plastic in our oceans than fish and that’s mainly down to such bottles. ‘We are trying to create a sense that being environmentally<b> sophisticated </b>is a status symbol,’ he adds. ‘We <b>want people</b> to clip their bottles onto what they are wearing, to show that they are<b> recycling </b>– and to look cool.","<b>D.</b>  Ferrando’s story is fascinating <b>because it seems</b> like an indicator of something unexpected. Three decades ago,<b> conspicuous </b>consumption – the purchase of luxuries, such as handbags, shoes, cars, etc. on a lavish scale –<b> heightened </b>people’s <b>social status</b>. Indeed, the closing decades of the 20th century were a time when it seemed that anything could be turned into a commodity. Hence the fact that water became a consumer item, sold in plastic bottles, <b>instead of just</b> emerging, for free, from a tap.","<b>E.</b>  Today, though,<b> conspicuous </b>extravagance <b>no longer</b> seems desirable among consumers. Now,<b> recycling </b>is fashionable – as is <b>cycling rather</b> than driving. Plastic <b>water bottles</b> <b>have become</b> so common that they do not command status; instead, what many millennials – <b>young people</b> born in the late 20th century – prefer to post on <b>social media</b> are ‘real’ (refillable) bottles or even the once widespread Thermos bottles. Some teenagers currently think that these stainless-steel vacuum insulated <b>water bottles</b> that are <b>coming back</b> onto the market are ultra ‘cool’; never mind the fact that they feel oddly out-of-date to anyone over the age of 40 or that teenagers in the 1970s would have avoided ever being seen with one.","<b>F.</b>  It is uncertain whether Clesca will succeed in its goal. Although its foldable bike helmet is available in some outlets in <b>New York</b>, including the Museum of Modern Art, it can be very hard for any design<b> entrepreneur </b>to really take off in the global mass market, though not as hard as it might have been in the past. If an<b> entrepreneur </b>had wanted to fund a smart invention a <b>few decades</b> ago, he or she would <b>have had</b> to either raise a bank loan, borrow money from a <b>family member</b> or use a <b>credit card</b>. <b>Things have</b> moved on slightly since then.","<b>G.</b> <b> Entrepreneurs </b>are still using the <b>last two</b> options, but some are also tapping into the ever-growing pot of money that is becoming available in the management world for ‘corporate<b> social </b>responsibility’ (CSR) investments. And then there are other options for those who wish to <b>raise money</b> <b>straight away</b>. Ferrando posted details about his water-bottle venture on a large , recognised platform for funding creative projects. He appealed for people to donate $30,000 of seed money – the money he needed to get his project going – and promised to give a bottle to anyone who provided more than $39 in ‘donations’. If he received the funds, he stated that the company would produce bottles in grey and white; if $60,000 was raised, a multicoloured one would be made. Using this approach, none of the donors has a stake in his idea, nor does he <b>have any</b> debt. Instead, it is almost a pre-sale of the product, in a manner that tests demand in advance and creates a potential crowd of enthusiasts. This oldfashioned community funding with a digital twist is supporting a growing array of projects ranging from films to card games, videos, watches and so on. And, at last count, Closca had raised some $52,838 from 803 backers. Maybe, 20 years from now, it will be the plastic bottle that seems peculiarly old-fashioned.","How to choose your builder","Building a new home is a signiﬁcant investment, and it’s essential to ﬁnd the right builder for the job. Before you look for a builder, it’s important to develop a<b> comprehensive </b>budget and have clear plans. <b>Once you have</b> a design in mind, it is <b>time to start</b> narrowing down your builder shortlist, and this starts with assessing how qualiﬁed each builder is. In Australia, this means checking that the builder holds a<b> residential </b>building licence. Most states <b>have their own</b> building authority who you can contact to check a builder’s licence.","You can also check if the builder is a member of an industry association such as the Housing Industry Association (HIA), and whether they have won any industry awards. For instance, the HIA runs a state and national awards programme, with a category that recognises the level of <b>customer service</b> that a builder delivers.","Most experts agree that display homes (homes constructed by the builder that are <b>open to the public</b>) offer a <b>great opportunity</b> to study their work <b>up close</b>. Display homes are usually offered by major project builders who work on a large scale and can deliver <b>good quality</b> and value . You can also talk to the salesperson and ﬁnd out about the home design and what is and isn’t included in the sale price. And it may be possible to talk to other customers you meet there and ask their opinion of the workmanship in the display home.","Finally, avoid signing any business contract before you <b>have read</b> and understood it thoroughly. Ask your builder to use a standard building contract that has been designed to comply with the Domestic Building Contracts Act, and to be fair to both client and builder. You have ﬁve business days within which you may<b> withdraw </b>from the contract after signing it.","Island adventure activities","<b>A.</b>  Rib riding","Conquer stormy seas on a high-speed ride in an RIB (Rigid Inﬂatable Boat ).

For instance,<b> inspectors </b>could make employers aware of what they really <b>need to know</b>, rather than swamping them with mountains of leaﬂets which may not be relevant.","Improvements are being made, however. The <b><b>Health and Safety</b> Executive</b> has issued a free guide to the <b>most important</b> <b>health and safety</b> laws for employers.

It is advisable to involve employees in this process, as they have direct experience.","Assessing and identifying risks is the <b>starting point</b>. But to comply with the law, businesses must train their employees about <b>health and safety</b>, and provide information to others who <b>need to know</b>, such as the contractors working for them. These are often smaller companies that carry out most of the dangerous work. Helping them to get into good safety habits <b>makes it easier</b> for them to tender for work from big companies.","Other advice from the <b><b>Health and Safety</b> Executive</b> for <b>small businesses</b><b> tackles </b>speciﬁc issues, such as helping small companies to deal with work-related stress.","Jobs in <b>Ancient Egypt</b>","In order to be engaged in the higher professions in <b>ancient Egypt</b>, a <b>person had</b> co be literate and so ﬁrst had to become a scribe. The apprenticeship for this job lasted many years and was tough and challenging. It principally involved memorizing hieroglyphic symbols and practicing handwritten lettering.<b> Scribes </b>noted the everyday activities in <b>ancient Egypt</b> and wrote about everything from grain stocks to tax records. Therefore, most of our information on this rich culture comes from their records. Most<b> scribes </b>were men from privileged backgrounds. The<b> occupation </b>of<b> scribe </b>was among the most sought-after in <b>ancient Egypt</b>. Craftspeople endeavored to get their sons into the school for scribes, but they were rarely successful. As in many civilizations, the lower classes provided the means for those above them to live comfortable lives. You needed to work if you wanted to eat, but there was no shortage of jobs at <b>any time</b> in Egypt’s history. The commonplace items <b>taken for granted</b> today, such as a brush or bowl, had to be made by hand;<b> laundry </b>had to be washed by hand, clothing sewn, and<b> sandals </b>made from<b> papyrus </b>and palm leaves. In <b>order to make</b> these and have paper to write on,<b> papyrus </b>plants had to be harvested, processed and distributed and all these jobs needed workers. There were rewards and sometimes diﬃculties. The<b> reed </b>cutter, for example, who harvested<b> papyrus </b>plants along the Nile, had to <b>bear in mind</b> that he worked in an area that was <b>also home</b> to wildlife that, at times, could prove fatal.","At the bottom rung of all these jobs were the people who served as the basis for the entire economy: the farmers. Farmers usually did not own the land they worked. They were given food, implements, and living<b> quarters </b>as payment for their labor. Although there were many more glamorous jobs than farming, farmers were the backbone of the Egyptian economy and<b> sustained </b>everyone else.","The details of lower-class jobs are known from medical reports on the treatment of injuries, letters, and documents written on various professions, literary works, tomb inscriptions, and artistic representations. This evidence presents a<b> comprehensive </b>view of daily work in <b>ancient Egypt</b> – how the jobs were done, and sometimes how people felt about the work. In general, the Egyptians <b>seem to have</b> felt pride in their work <b>no matter</b> what their occupation. Everyone <b>had some</b>thing to contribute to the community, and no skills <b>seem to have</b> been considered non-essential. The potter who produced cups and bowls was as important to the community as the scribe, and the amulet-maker as vital as the pharmacist.","Part of making a living, regardless of one’s special skills, was raking part in the king’s<b> monumental </b>building projects. Although it is commonly believed that the great monuments and temples of Egypt were achieved through slave labor, there is absolutely no <b>evidence to support</b> this. The<b> pyramids </b>and other monuments were built by Egyptian<b> laborers </b>who either donated their time as community service or were paid for their labor, and Egyptians from every<b> occupation </b>could be called on to do this.","Stone had to ﬁrst be<b> quarried </b>and chis required workers to split the blocks from the rock cliffs. It was done by inserting wooden wedges in the rock which would swell and cause the stone to break from the face. The often huge blocks were then pushed onto sleds, devices better suited than wheeled<b> vehicles </b>to moving weighty objects over shifting sand. They were then rolled to a different location where they could be cut and shaped. This job was done by skilled stonemasons working with copper<b> chisels </b>and wooden mallets. As the<b> chisels </b>could gee blunt, a<b> specialist </b>in<b> sharpening </b>would take the tool, sharpen it, and bring it back. This would have been constant daily work as the masons could wear down their tools on a single block.","The blocks were then moved into position by unskilled laborers. These people were mostly farmers who could do nothing with their land during the months when the Nile River overﬂowed its banks. Egyptologists Bob Brier and Hoyt Hobbs explain: ‘For <b>two months</b> annually, workmen gathered by the tells of thousands from all over the country to transport the blocks a permanent crew had<b> quarried </b>during the rest of the year. Overseers organized the men into teams to transport the stones on the sleds.’ Once the<b> pyramid </b>was complete, the inner chambers needed to be decorated by<b> scribes </b>who painted<b> elaborate </b>images on the walls. Interior work on tombs and temples <b>also required</b><b> sculptors </b>who could expertly cut away the stone around certain ﬁgures or<b> scenes </b>that had been painted.","While these artists were highly skilled, everyone – <b>no matter</b> what their job for the rest of the year – was expected to contribute to communal projects. This practice was in keeping with the value of ma’at (harmony and balance) which was central to Egyptian culture. One was expected to care for others as much as oneself and contributing to the common good was an expression of this. There is <b>no doubt</b> there were <b>many people</b> who did not love their job <b>every day</b>, but the Egyptian government was aware of how hard the people worked and so staged a number of festivals <b>throughout the year</b> to show gratitude and give them days off to relax.","Maps showing walks starting from Bingham <b>Town Hall</b>","<b>A.</b>  The walk described in this leaflet takes you to one of the many places in the district where bricks were made for <b>hundreds of years</b>, until it was closed in the late 19th century.

Please note that the <b>ground is very</b> uneven, and under- sixes should not be taken on this walk.","<b>B.</b>  This walk will take you to the top of Burley Hill, along a nice easy path that people of <b>all ages</b> will be <b>able to manage</b>. From the summit you can see for a great distance to the north and west, across a landscape that includes half a dozen lakes and the entrance to Butter Caves. <b>Bear in mind</b>, though, that mist often comes in from the sea and covers the hilltop.","<b>C.</b>  This route leads you through the village of Cottesloe, which was created in the 1930s and is famous for its strange-looking houses and<b> ceramics </b>factory, which is still the largest employer in the area. An artificial lake was originally created beside the village, and has since been filled in and turned into an <b>adventure playground</b>. After you leave Cottesloe, you have a choice of routes to return to the <b>starting point</b>, so either continue via Thurley Park, or if it’s raining, take the shorter direct route.","<b>D.</b>  This walk is ideal in fine weather, as it takes you to the shore of a lake, at a spot convenient for swimming. Children will want to enjoy themselves in the <b>adventure playground</b> nearby. From there you continue to Starling Cottage, which draws people from a<b>round the world</b> to visit the home, from 1920 to 1927, of the poet Barbara Cottam.","<b>E.</b>  If you want an easy, undemanding walk over flat ground, this walk will suit you perfectly. It passes the entrance to the famous Butter Caves visitor attraction, so you can combine a visit there with the walk, or <b>just take</b> shelter if it starts raining! On the <b>final stage</b> of the walk you pass through Wimpole, the village where Richard Merton, the architect of a number of local buildings, lived for much of his life.","The Maplehampton<b> scarecrow </b>competition – a <b>great success</b>!","There was once a time when farmers all over the country put<b> scarecrows </b>in fields of growing crops. A traditional<b> scarecrow </b>was a model – usually life-size – of a man or woman dressed in old clothes, and their purpose was to<b> frighten </b>the <b>birds away</b>; though how successful they were is a matter of opinion!","Maplehampton’s<b> scarecrow </b>competition <b>took place</b> on September 12th. <b>Local farmers</b> supplied everything needed to make a<b> scarecrow </b>– like pieces of wood to form a frame, and<b> straw </b>to stuff the scarecrow. The<b> scarecrows </b>were dressed in old clothes which the competitors brought with them.","The festival was held in the village hall, instead of outdoors as planned, due to the<b> unusually </b>high temperature. There were two classes, one for adults and one for children, all of them working in small teams. Over 20 teams took part, each creating one scarecrow. They were encouraged by an audience of around 50, and had ideas and guidance from local artist Tracey Sanzo.","The<b> scarecrows </b>were judged by a team of people from the village. The winning children’s <b>team made</b> a<b> scarecrow </b>that <b>looked like</b> a giant bird – which would surely keep every real bird away! The winning adult team’s<b> scarecrow </b>was dressed as an alien from another planet, and its face was painted to make it look very<b> frightening </b>– at least to <b>human beings</b>!","After the judging, many of the participants and the<b> spectators </b>had a picnic which they had brought. Some of the<b> scarecrows </b>then went home to their creators’ gardens. Alice Cameron, a local farmer, liked one of the<b> scarecrows </b>so much, she bought it to stand on her balcony: she said she didn’t need it to<b> scare </b><b>birds away</b> from her crops, as only bird-scarers that made a noise were effective. She <b>just want</b>ed to be able to see it! The event raised over £300 for village funds.","Feathers as decoration in European history","<b>A.</b>  Today, we do not generally associate feathers with the military in Europe, yet history shows that in fact feathers have played an<b> intriguing </b>role in European military clothing. The Bersaglieri of the Italian Army, for example, still wear a bunch of long black feathers in their hats hanging down to <b>one side</b>, while British fusiliers have a clipped feather plume whose colour varies according to their regiment. The Royalists in the English <b>Civil War</b> adorned their headgear with<b> ostrich </b>feathers. ‘Historically, feathers were an incredibly<b> expressive </b>accessory for men,1 observes Cambridge historian, Professor Ulinka Rublack. ‘Nobody has really looked at why this was the case. That’s a story that! <b>want to tell</b>.’","Rublack is beginning to study the use of featherwork in early modern fashion as part of a joint project between the Universities of Cambridge, Basel and Bern. To the outsider, its preoccupations (her co-researchers are studying gold, glass and veils) might seem surprising. Yet such materials<b> sustained </b>significant economies and expertise.","<b>B.</b>  Rublack has spotted that something<b> unusual </b>started to happen with feathers during the 16th century. In 1500, they were barely worn at all in Europe; 100 <b>years later</b> they <b>had become</b> an indispensable accessory for the fashionable European man. In prosperous trading centres, the citizens started wearing hats bedecked with feathers from cranes and swallows. Headgear was<b> specially </b>manufactured so that feathers could be inserted more easily. By 1573, Plantin’s Flemish-French dictionary was even obliged to offer words to describe people who chose not to wear them, recommending such terms as: ‘the featherless’ and ‘unfeathered’.","Featherworking became <b>big business</b>. From Prague and Nuremberg to Paris and Madrid, people started to make a living from decorating feathers for clothing.<b> Impressive </b>efforts went into dyeing them. A 1548 recipe recommends using ashes, lead<b> monoxide </b>and river water to create a ‘very beautiful’ black, for example.","<b>C.</b>  Why this happened will become clearer as Rublack’s project develops. One crucial driver, however, was<b> exploration </b>– the discovery of new lands, especially in <b>South America</b>. Compared with <b>many of the other</b><b> species </b>that <b>early European</b> colonists encountered,<b> exotic </b>birds could be captured, transported and kept with relative ease. Europe experienced a sudden ‘bird-craze’, as<b> exotic </b>birds became a relatively common sight in the continent’s largest markets.","Given the link with new<b> territories </b>and conquest, ruling elites wore feathers partly to express their power and reach. But there were also more complex reasons. In 1599, for example, Duke Frederick of Wurttemberg held a display at his court at which he personally appeared wearing a costume covered in<b> exotic </b>feathers and representing the Americas. This was not just a symbol of power, but of cultural connectedness, Rublack suggests: The message seems to be that he was embracing the global in a duchy that was quite<b> insular </b>and territorial.’","<b>D.</b>  Nor were feathers worn by the powerful alone. In 1530, a legislative assembly at Augsburg imposed restrictions on<b> peasants </b>and traders adopting what it clearly felt should be an elite fashion. The measure did not last, perhaps because health manuals of the<b> era </b>recommended feathers could keep the wearer safe from ‘bad’ air – cold, miasma, damp or<b> excessive </b>heat – all of which were regarded as hazardous. During the 1550s, Eleanor of Toledo had hats made from peacock feathers to keep her dry in the rain. Gradually, feathers came to indicate that the wearer was healthy and civilised. Artists and<b> musicians </b>took to wearing them as a mark of subtlety and style.","<b>E.</b>  As with most fads, this<b> enthusiasm </b>eventually wore off. By the mid-17th century, feathers were out of style, with one striking exception. Within the armies of Europe feathers remained an essential part of military costume. Rublack thinks that there may have been several reasons for this strange contradiction. ‘It’s associated with the notion of graceful warfaring,’ she says. This was a period when there were no standing armies and it was hard to draft soldiers. One solution was to aestheticise the military, to make it seem graceful and powerful.’ Feathers became associated with the idea of an art of warfare. They were also already a part of military garb among many native American peoples and in the Ottoman empire. Rublack believes that just as some of these cultures considered the feathers of certain birds to be highly significant, and sometimes sacred, European soldiers saw the feathers as imparting noble passions,<b> bravery </b>and courage.","<b>F.</b>  In time, her research may therefore reveal a tension about the ongoing use of feathers in this unlikely context. But, as she also notes, she is perhaps the first historian to have spotted the<b> curious </b>emotional<b> resonance </b>of feathers in military fashion at all. All this shows a sea-change in methodologies: historians now chart the ways in which our identities are shaped through deep connections with ‘stuff’ – the material objects that are parts of our lives."]},{"name":"GRE/16-4","paragraph":["<h2>The best hiking boots</h2>","Whether you’re climbing a mountain or walking in the country, be sure to buy the right boots, writes Sian Lewis","<b>A.</b>  Hanwag Tatra Boots","These boots are expensive but will give you a lifetime of wear.

In one town in 18th- century Scotland, single women played an annual match against their married counterparts, though the motives behind the contest were not purely sporting. Some accounts say that the games were watched by a crowd of single men, who hoped to pick out a potential bride based on her footballing ability.","By the late 19th century, with the men’s game spreading across Britain like wildfire, women also began to <b>take up</b> association football. Early pioneers included Nettie J Honeyball, who founded the British Ladies’ Football Club (BLFC) in 1895. Honeyball was an alias: <b>like many</b> of the middle- and upper-class women who played in the late 19th century, she was not keen to publicise her involvement with a contact sport played on muddy fields. We know more about Lady Florence Dixie, who was appointed president of the BLFC in 1895 and who was an<b> ardent </b>believer in equality between the sexes.","The BLFC arranged games between teams representing the north and the south of England, where money would be raised for those in need. These initially attracted healthy numbers of supporters although early newspaper reports were not particularly generous, with one reporter suggesting ‘when the novelty has worn off, I do not chink women’s football will attract the crowds’. And crowds did drop off as the <b>growing popularity</b> of the men’s game came to dominate public interest. In a country where women were not y<b>et al</b>lowed to vote, it would take extraordinary circumstances for their efforts on the football<b> pitch </b>to attract widespread attention.","Those circumstances arose in 1914 with the outbreak of the <b><b>First World</b> War</b>. With many men leaving their jobs to join the army, women started to work in factories and just as men had done before them, they began to play informal games of football during their lunch breaks. After some initial uncertainty, their<b> superiors </b><b>came to see</b> these games as a means to boost<b> morale </b>and thus increase productivity. Teams soon formed and friendly matches were arranged.","In the town of Preston in the north of England, the female workers at a manufacturing <b>company called</b> Dick, Kerr & Co showed a particular aptitude for the game. Watching from a window above the yard where they played, <b>office work</b>er Alfred Frankland spotted their talent and he set about forming a team. Under Frankland’s management, they soon<b> drew </b>significant crowds to see their games. Known as Dick, Kerr’s Ladies, they beat<b> rival </b>factory Arundel Coulthard 4-0 on Christmas Day 1917, with 10,000 watching at Preston stadium.","History of women’s football in Britain: <b><b>Reading Answers</b> PDF</b>","After the war ended in 1918 the Dick, Kerr’s side and other women’s teams continued to draw large crowds. In 1920 there were around 150 women’s sides in England and Dick, Kerr’s Ladies packed 53,000 into Everton’s Goodison Park stadium. The same year, the <b>team found</b> their one true genius: Lily Parr. Parr <b>grew up</b> playing football with her brothers, and began her career with her town’s ladies’ team at the age of 14. When they played against the Dick, Kerr’s side, she caught Frankland’s eye and was offered a job at the factory – as well as a spot on the team. Close to six-feet tall and with jet-black hair, she had a ferocious appetite and a fierce left foot. She is credited with 43 goals during her first season playing for Dick, Kerr’s Ladies and around 1,000 in total.","By 1921 Dick, Kerr’s Ladies were regularly attracting crowds in the <b>tens of thousands</b>. But the year ended in catastrophe for the women’s game. The Football Association (FA) – officially the governing body for the sport as a whole, but really only concerned with men’s competitions — <b>had always</b> taken a poor view of female participation. Women’s football was tolerated during the war, but in the years that followed, driven by the fear that the women’s game could affect Football League attendances, the FA<b> sought </b>to assert itself.","Its solution was decisive and brutal. On 5 December 1921, the FA banned its members from allowing women’s football to be played at its grounds, saying that football was ‘quite<b> unsuitable </b>for females’. The FA also forbade its members from acting as referees at women’s games. To all intents and purposes, women’s football in England was outlawed.","The FA also suggested that an<b> excessive </b>proportion of the gate receipts were absorbed in expenses and an<b> inadequate </b>percentage<b> devoted </b>to charity. No such obligation to donate profits existed for men’s clubs and no proof of financial mismanagement was presented, but there was little the women’s clubs could do in response. There was outrage from players, with the captain of Plymouth Ladies remarking that the FA was ‘a <b>hundred years</b> behind the times’ and calling its decision ‘purely sex prejudice’.","It was not until 1966 that serious efforts to revive the women’s game began, but progress remained painfully slow. It took pressure from the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), to finally force the FA to end restrictions on women’s football in 1971. By this time, half a century of progress had been lost."]}]
